be thought that heat generatee motion, or motion hest

- (though in some respecta thie be true), but that the very

essenoe ot hest, or the substantia} seli ⁸· oi heat, is motion
and nothing else, limited‚ however, by certain differenoeu
which we will presently add, after giving some cautione for
avoiding ambiguity.

Sensible hest is relative, and regards man, not πίνοι-σος
and is rightly held to be merely the effect of hest on animal
spirit. It is even variable in ineis, sinoe the nme body (in
different etates of sensation) excites the feeling oi hest and

approach ot a heated body, with the form ot he⁸t3 for hest ·

is one thing and heating another. Heat ean be exeited by
friction without any previous hosting body, and, therefore,
heating ie exeluded fromthe form of heat- Even when hest
is exeited by the approach of a hot body, this depende not
on the form of heat, but on another more profound and eom·

about which a separate inquiry must be made. .

motion, by whieh the body etz-iven to dilate iteelf, and to
