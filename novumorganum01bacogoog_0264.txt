brings ont our several limbs and parts by separation and
rejection. But to leave such u-ifling‚ it is most certain that
all the parts of vegetables and animala, as well the homo·
geneous as organie‚ first of all attract those jnices contained
in their food, which are nearly common, or at least not very
different, and then assimilata and convert them into their
own nature. Nor does this assimilation, or simple genera.-
tion‚ take place in animated bodies only, but the inanimato
also participate in the same property (as we have observed
of flame and air), and that languid spirit, which is contained
in every tangible animaoed substance, is perpetually work·
ing upon the coarser parts, and converting them into spirit,

· = which aftervsvard is exhaled‚ whence ensnes a diminution of

weight‚ and a desiccation of which we 'have spoken else·
where*

Nor should we, in speaking of assimilation, neglect ”

to mention the accretion which is usually distinguished
from aliment, and' which is observed when mud grows into
a mass between stones, and is converted into a· stony sub·

’ stance, and the scaly substance round the teeth is converted

into one no less hard than the teeth themselves3 for we are
of opinion that there existe in all bodies a desire of assim·
ilation, as well as of uniting with homogeneous masses.
Each of these powers, however, is confined, although in
different manners, and should be diligently investigaoed,
because they are connected with the revival of old age.
Lastly, it is worthy of observation‚ that in the nine
preceding motione, bodies appear to aim at the mere
preservation of their nature, while in this they attempt

its propagation.
