XLII. In the nineteenth rank oi prerogative instanoes
we will class supplementa-y or substitutive instances, which
we are also went to call instan'oes oi refuge. They are such
as supply information, where the senses are entirely defi-
cient, and we therefore have recourse ιο them when appro-
priate instsnoes cannot be obtained. This substitution is
