6. ‘l'he direction oi motion (which is the fifth method
of action) is oi no small use. We adopt this term, when
speaking of a body which, meeting with another, either
arrests, repels, allows, or directe its original motion. This
-. is the case principally in the figure and position of vessels.
An upright cone, for instance, promotes the condensation·
oi vapor in alembics, but when reversed, as in inverted
vessels, it assiste the refining of sugat. Sometimes a curved
form, o'r one alternately contracted and dilated, is required.
Strainers may be ranged under this head, where the opposed
body opens a wey for one portion of another substance and
impedes the rest. Nor is this process or any other direction
of motion carried on externally only, but sometimes by one
body within another. Thus, pebbles are thrown into water
to collect the ‘muddy particles, and syrups are refined by
the white of an egg, which glues the grosser particles to·
gether so as to facilitate.their removal. Telesius, indeed,
rashly and ignorantly enough attributes the formation of
animale to this cause, by means of the channels and iolds
oi the womb. He ought to have observed a similar forma·
tion of the young in eggs which have no wrinkles or ‘in-
equalities. One may obser-ve a real result oi this direction

oi motion in casting and modelling.

6. The effecte produced by harmony and aversion (which
is the sixth method) are frequently buried in obscurity3 for
these occult and specific properties (as they are termed), the
sympathies and antipathies, are for the most part but a
corruption of philosophy. Nor can we form any great
expectation of the discovery oi the hannony which exists
, between natural- objects, before that of their forms and
