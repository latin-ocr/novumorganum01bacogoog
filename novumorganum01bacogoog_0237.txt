gent examination of natur-es), on account of the power end
actions of bodies being ill defined and determined. Now
the powers and actions of bodies ere defined and determined
’ either by space or by time, or by 'the quantity at 8 given
period, or by the predominnnce of energy; and if these four
circumstances be not well and diligently considered, the
sciences may indeed be beautiful in theory, but ure of no
effect in practice. We 0811 the four instances referred ιο
this class, mathematicel instances and instances of measure.

Praetice is laborious either from the multitude ot instru-
mente, or the bulk of matter and substances requisito for
any given work. Those 188ι88008, sponsore, ere velusble‚

For the powers and motione of bodies do not 8οι 88ᾶ take
effect through indefinite and accidentnL but through limited
and certain spaces; end it is of great importenoe ιο practice
that these should be understood end noted in every nature
which is investigated‚ 8οι only ιο prevent deception‚ bnt⁶
