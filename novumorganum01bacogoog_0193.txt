For example: let the required nature be hest. Flame
is an accompanying instance; for in water„ air, stone, motai,
and many other substances, hest is verieble, and oen ap·
proach or retire; but all fleme is hot, so thet hest always
accompam'es the concretion of firme. We heve no hostile
instance oi hest3 for the senses are unacquainted with the
interior of the earth, end there is no concretion os any
known body which is not susceptible of beat. .

Again, let solidity be the required nathre... Air is a.
hostile instance; for metels may be liquid or solid, so may
glass; even water may become solid by congelation, but air
cannot become solid or lose its fluidity. ,

With regau-d to these instances of fixed propositione,
there are two points to be observed‚ which are oi impor-
tance. First, that it there be no universal affirmative or.
negative, it be osrefully noted as not existing. Thus, in
hest, we have observed that there exists no universal nego·
tive, in such substances‚ et least, as heve come to our
knowledge. Agein, if the required nature be eternity or
incorruptibility, we have no universal affirmative within
our sphere, for these qualities cannot be predicated of any
Π bodies below the heavens, or above the interior of the earth.
Secondly, to our general propositione as to any concrete,
whether affirmative or negative, we should subjoin the·
concretes which appear to approach nearest to the non·
existing substenoes3 such as the most gentle or least·
burning flames in hest, or gold in incorruptibility, since it
approaches nearest to it. For they all serve to show the
limit of existence and non-existence, and circumscribe
forms, so that they cannot wandel· beyond the conditione
of matter. . · .
