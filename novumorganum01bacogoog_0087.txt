experimenta have been committed to paper. We cannot,
however a rove of an mode discover without vritin
and when that comes into more general uae, we may have
further hopea. ·

before the eyes a collection oi particulare, we must not im·

mediately proceed to the investigation and discovery oi new

 

particulare or effecta, or, at least, it we do so, must not rest
satisfied therewith. For, though tre do not deny that by
transferring the experimenta from one art to another (when
all the experimenta of each have been collected and ar·
ranged, and have been acquired by the knowledge, and
subjected to the jndgment oi a single individual), many
new experimenta may be discovered tending to beneflt
society and mankind, by what we term litei-ate experience3
yet comparatively insignificant results are to be expected

thence, while the more imEgrtant are to be derived irom

the new light of axioma, deduced bg certain method and

rule from the above Earticulars, and pointing out and de·
fining new particulare in their turn. Our road ia not a long

plain, but riees and falls, ascending to axioma, and descend·
