We hear that come cort of boat or veeeel hae now been
invented, capable of carrying men some distance under
water. Any bodies, however, can easily be suspended
under aome euch· veeeel ae we have mentioned, which hae
occasioned our remarks upon the experiment.

Another advantage oi the careful and hermetical cloeing

of bodies ie this—not only the'admission of exter-nal air ie ’

prevented (of which we have treated), bnt the spirit of
bodiee aleo ia prevented from making its escape, which
is an inter-nal operation. For any one operating on natural
bodies mnet be certain aa ιο their quantity, and that noth-

ing hae evaporated or escaped, since profonnd alterationes

take place in‘hodiea, when art preventa the lose or escape
of any portion, while nature prevento their annihilation.

With regar-d to thie circumstance, a false idea has prevailed .
³ (which if true would make ua despair οἱ preserving qnan- ·

tity without diminution), namely, that the spirit ot bodies,
and air when rarefied by a great degree οἱ heat, cannot be
eo kept in by being incloeed in any veeeel as not to escape
by the small poree. Men are led into this idea by the com·
mon experimenta of a cup inverted over water, with a candle
or piece of lighted paper in it, by which the water ie drawn
r up, and of those cupe which, when heated, draw up tho
fleeh. For they think that in each experiment the rarefied
air escapee, and that ite quantity is therefore diminished,
by which meane the water or flesh rieea by the motion of
connection. 'Phia is, however, most inc'orrect. For the air
, ie not diminished in quantity, but contr-acted in dimen-
eiona,⁰⁸ nor does this motion of the rising of the water

⁸² Part of the air ia expanded and κουροι, and part ie conaumed hy th
fiune. When condeneed, therefore, by the cold application, it cannot offer eui·
