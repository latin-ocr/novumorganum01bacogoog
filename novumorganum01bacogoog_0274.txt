predominates over that of tension, bnt if the tension be
greater, the leather breaks, and the motion of continuity
yields. A certain quantity oi water flows through a chink,
and so. far the motion of greater congregation predominates
over that of continuit-y, but if. the chink be smaller it yields.
κ ῙΞ a musket be charged with ban and powdered sulphur
alone, and fire be applied, the bau is not discharged, in -
which case the motion of greater congregation overcomes
that oi matta-3 bnt when gnnpowder is used, the motion oi
matter in the sulphur predominates, being assisted by that ⁸
motion, and the motion of avoidance in the nitre; and so
oi the rest. For wrestling instances (which show the pre·
dominance of powers, and in what manner and proportion
they predominate and yield) must be searched for with
active and industrions diligence.

'Phe methods and nature of this yielding must also be
diligently examined, as for instance, whether the motions
completely cease, or exert themselves, but are constrained.
For in the bodies with which we are acquainted, there is no
real but an apparent rest, either in the whole or in parts.
'l'his apparent. rest is occasioned either by equilibrinm, or
the absolute predominance of motione. By equilibrinm,
as in the scales of the balance, which rest it the weights
be equal. By predominance, as in perforated jars, in which
the water rests, and is prevented from falling by the pre-

dominance oi the motion of connection. It is, however, to .

be obser-ved (as we have said before), how iar the yielding
motion's exert themselves, For if a man be held stretched
ont on the ground against his will, with arms and legs
”bound down, or otherwise confined, and yet strive with all
his power to get up, the struggle is not the less, although
ineffectual. 'Phe real state oi the case (namely, whether
