a sufficient quantity of water to allow the air to recover
its former dimensions.'⁸ · ’

It is well ascertained that rare bodies (such as air) admit
of considerable contraction, as has been before observed3
but tangible bodies (such as water) admit oi it much less
readily, and to a less extent. We investigated the latter
point by the following experiment: -

ΨΘ, had a lesden globo inade, capable of containing
about two pints, wine measure, and of tolerable thickness,
sons to support considerable pressure. We poured water
into it through an aperture, „which we afterward closed with
rnelted lead, as soon as the globe was filled with water, so
that the whole became periectly solid. ΨΘ next flattened
the two opposite sides with a heavy hammer, which neces·
sarily caused the water to occupy a less space, since the
sphere is the solid of greatest conteut3 and when hammer·

⁶ ing failed irom the resistance of the water, we made nse of

a mill or prese, till at last the water, refusing to submit
to a greater pressure, exuded like a fine dew through· the
solid lead. We then computed the extent to which the
original space had been reduced, sud concluded that water
admitted such a degree of compression when constrained
,by great violence.

The more solid, dry or compact bodies, such as stones,
wood sud metals, admit of much less, and indeed scarcely
any perceptible compression or expansion, but escape by
breaking, slipping forward, or other efforts3 as appears in
bending wood, or steel for watch-springs, in projectiles,
- hammering and many other motions, all of which, together

'⁸ This passage shows that the pressure of the externa! atmosphere, which
toton the water into the egg, was not in Bsoon's time umorem—Ea.
