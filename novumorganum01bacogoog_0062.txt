For there are deserte and wastes in times as in countries,

both in the quantity and richness of the sciences produced.
Nor need we mention the Arabs, or the scholastic philoso-
phy, which, in those ages, ground down the sciences by
their numerous treatises, more than they increased their
weight. 'Phe first cause, then, of such insignificant prog-
