Let ,the thirteenth motion be that ot impression, which
in also a species of motion of assimilation‚ and the most
subtile of diffusive motione. We have thought it right,
however, to consider it aa a distinet species, on account of
its remarkable difference from the last ἐντος for the simple
motion of assimilation transforma the bodies themselves, so
that it you remove the first agent, you diminish not the
effect of those which sueoeed; thus, neither the first light·
ing ol flame, nor the first conversion into air, are of any
importance to the flame or air next generated. So, also,

- the motion of excitement still continues for a considerable

time after the removal of the first agent, as in a heated
body on the removal ot the original heat, in the excited
- iron on the removal of the magnet, and in the dough on
the removal ol the leaven. But the motion of impression,
although diffusive and transitive, appears, nevertheless‚ to
depend on the first agent, so that upon the removal of the
latter the former immediately fails and perishes; for which
reason also it takes effect in a moment, or at least a very
short space of time. We are wont to call the two former
motione the motione of the generation of Jupiter, because
when born they continue to exist3 and the latter, the mo·
tion of the generation of Saturn, because it is immediately
devoured and absorbed. It may be seen in three instances:
1, in the rays of light3 2, in the percussione ot sounds; 3,
in magnetic attractione as regards communication. For, on
the removal of light, colors and all its other images disap-
pear, as on the cessation of the first percussion and the
vibration of the body, sound soon fails, and although
