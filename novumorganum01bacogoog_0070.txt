'04 Rom. ORGANUM

’1 would soon cesse to &mire and rather pitz the hnman- lot ·

ἰ on moount of its ¹vast want and dearth oi things and discov· .
' eries ior so menz ages. Yet even the discoveries we have

mentioned were more ancient than philosophy and the intel·

But if ang one turn from the manniactories to librarios,

he listens to tradition and vagae whispers, or imagines there
is ‘some slight unsteadiness in the minute details of his
practice, and then has recourse to an endless repetition of
experimenta: and in the meantime, when, in his casual ex·
periments, he falls upon something in appearance new, or
oi some degree of utility, he consoles himself with such an
earnest, and ostentatiously publishes them, keeping up his
hope ot the final result. Nor can it be denied that the alche-
