8⁷. 'rhem are many degi-ees in the susceptibility oi heat.

- And, first, it must be observed how much a low gentle heat

changes and partially warms even the bodies least suscep·
tible oi it. For even the heat of the hand imparts a little
warmth to a ball oi lead οι· other mctal held a short time in
it3 'so easily is heat transmitted and excited, without any
apparent change in the body.

38. Of all bodies that we are acquainted with, air adrnits
and loses heat the most readily, which is admirably seen in
-weather·glasses, whose construction is as follows: 'Pake a
glass with a hollcw belly, and a thin and long neck3 turn
it upside down, and place it with its mouth downward into
another glass vesscl containing water3 the end oi the· tube
touching the bottom of the vesseI, and the tube itseli lean-
ing a little on the edge‚ so as to be fixcd upright. In order
to do this more readily‚ let a little wax be applied to the
alge, not, however, 8ο as to block up the orifice, lest, by
preven ting the air from escaping, the motion, which we
shall presently speak of, and which is very gentle and deli·
cate, should be impeded.

Before the first glass be inserted in the other, its upper
part (the belly) should be wat-med at the fire. 'Phen upon
placing i* as we have described, the air (which was dilated
by the heat), aster a sufficient time has been allowed for it
to lose the additional temperature, will restore and contract
itself to the same dimensions as that oi the external or com·
mon atmosphere at the moment oi immersion, and the water
will be attracted upward in the tube to a proportionate ex·
tent. A long nan-ow slip of papcr should be attached to

’ nore quickly only muse the draught ot air is more apid, the ccld dense

air passing rapidly ¹nto the heated roem and toward the chimney.-Ed.
