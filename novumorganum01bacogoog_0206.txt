from thet of the -world, which two circumstances heve occs-
sioned this notion. For the first phenomenon is well ac-
oounted ior by the spheres overtaking or falling behind
esch other, and the second by spirsl lines3 so that the in·
sccurscy of the return and declination to the tropics. may
be rather modificatione of the one' diurnsl motion than con·
trary motione, or about different poles. And it is most
, certain, if we consider ourselves for s moment ns part of
the vulgar (setting asido the fictione of astronomers and the
school, who sre wont undeservedly to attack the senses in
many respects‚ and to effect obscurity), that the apparent
motion is such as we have said, s model oi which we have
sometimes caused to be represented by wires in a sort of a
machine. Δ ‘

We may take the following instances os the cross upon
this subject. :tf it be found in· any history worthy of credit,
thet there hes existed any comet, high or low, which hes
not revolved in manifest harmony (however irregnlsrly) with
the diurnsl motion, then we may decide so far as to allow
such a motion to be possible iu nature. But it nothing oi ·
the sort be found, it must be suspected, and recourse must
be had to other instances of the cross.

Agsin, let the required nature be weight or gravity.
Heavy snd ponderous bodies must, either of their own
nature, tend toward the centre of the earth by their peculisr
formation, or must be attracted and „hurried by the corporea}
mass of the earth itself‚ as being an assemblsge of similar
bodies, and be drawn to it by sympathy. But if the latter
be the cause, it follows that the nearer bodies approach to
the earth, the· more powerfully and rapidly they must be
borne toward it, end the further they, are distant, the more
faintly and slowly- (as is the case in magnetic sanctiens),
