nation at the difficulty οι iuquiry, and the obscurity of ,
things, and champings as it ⁴,were the bit, have still per·
sisted in pressing t‘h‘eir ffoi'ssnt and pursuing their inter·
course with nature, thinking, ·as it seems, that the better
method was ιιοι ιο dispute upon the very point of the pos·

· sibility of anything being known, but to put* it ιο the test

of experience. Yet they themselves, by only employing
the power οι the understanding, have not adopted a fixed
rule, but have laid their whole stress upon intense medita·
tion, and a ‚continual exercise and perpetual agitation of ·
the mind.

· Our method, though difficult ιιι its operation, is easily

explained. It consiste ιιι determining the degrees of cer·
tainty, while we, as ιι were, restore the seuses to their
former rank, but generally reiect that operation οι the
mind which follows close upon the senses, and open and

·establish a new and certain course for the mind from the

first actual perceptione of the senses themselves. This, ιιο

.- doubt, was the view taken by those who have assigned so
” ιιιιιοιιχ ιο logic; showing clearly thereby that they sought
Α some support for the mind, and suspected its ,natural and

spontaneous mode of action. But this is now employed
too late as a remedy, when all is clearly lost, and after the
mind, by the daily habit and intercourse ot life, has come
prepossessed with corrupted doctrines, and filled with the
vainest idols. The art οι logie therefore being (as we have
mentioned), too late a precaution,¹ and in no way remedy·

¹ Because it was idle to draw a logical conclusion trem talne principles, error
being propagated as much by salse premisse, which logie does not pretend to
examine, as by illegitimate interence. Hence, as Bacon says tux-ther on, men
being easily led ιο conscund legitimare inierence with truth, {ere confirmed
in their ermes by the very subtilty ot their genium-Ed.
