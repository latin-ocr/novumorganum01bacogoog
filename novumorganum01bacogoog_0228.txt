water, and when contracted raises it, which is the first
reduction to sight. . .

- Again, let the required nature be the mixture of bodiZsss
namely, how much aqueous, oleaginous or spirituous, ashy
or salt parts they contain; or, as a particular example, how
much butter, chasse, and whey there is in milk, and the,
like. 'l'hese things are rendered sensible by artificial and
nkfflul separatioris in tangible substances3 and the nature

is nevertheless discovered ΒΥ the various motions and ⁹ '

efforts oi bodies. And, indeed, in this branch men have
labored hard in distillatione and artificial separatione, but
with little more success than in their other experimento
now in use3 their methods being mere guesees and blind
attempta, and more industrious than intelligent3 and what
is voret of all, without any imitation or rivalry of nature,
but rather ΒΥ violent heato and too energetic agents, to the
destruction of any delicate conformation, in which princi·
pally consist the hidden virtues and sympathies. Nor do
·men in these separatione ever attend to or observe what we
have before pointed out; namely, that in attacking bodies

ΒΥ the fire itself, and the other bodies used to effect the
separation, which were not originally in the compound.
Hence arise most extraordinary fallacies3 ior the mass of

not exist as vapor or air in the water, but is chiefly created
ΒΥ the expansion of the water by the heat of the flre.

So, in general, all delicate experimenta on natural or

from the adulterated, and the better from the more com·
