which would otherwise attack their heads and bones, and
this piece soon grows white.⁸· Let this suffice for the mo·
tio». of lesser congregation.

Let the ninth be the magnetic motion, which, although
of the nature of that last mentioned, yet, when operating
at great distances, and on great messes, deserves a separate
inquiry, especially if it neither begin in contact, as most
motions ot congregation do, nor end by bringing the sub·
stances into contact, as all do, but only raise‘ thern, and
make them swell without any further effect. For it the
moon raise the waters, or cause meist substances to swell,
or if the starry sphere attract the planete toward their
apogees‚ or the sun confine the planets Mercnry and Venus
to within a certain distance of his mass;·⁸ these motione do
not appear capable of being classed under either of those
ot congregation, but to be, as it were, intermediately and
imperfectly congregati ve, and thus to form a distinct species.

Let the tenth motion be that of avoidance, or that which
is opposed to the motion of lesser congregation, by which
bodies, with a kind of antipathy, avoid and disperse, and
separate themselves from, or refuse to unite themselves
with others of a hostile nature. For although this may
sometimes appear to be an occidental motion, necessarily
attendant upon that of the lesser congregation, because the
homogeneous parts cannot unite, unless the heterogeneous
be first removed and excluded, yet it is still to be classed
separately,⁸' and considered as a distinct species, because,
