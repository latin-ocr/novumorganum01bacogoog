whether the latter (which cen easily be distinguished from
the former by ite color, for flames do not mix immediately,
as liquide do) continue pyramidal, or tend more to a globu-

Let this suffice for the instances oi the crosa. We have

dwelt the longer upon them in order gradually to teach and '

accustom mankind to judge of nature by theee metanoea, and
enlightening experimenta, and not by probable reaeonn.“

⁸⁸ 'rheae inuncet, which Bacon eeeme ω consider ae a great dleeovery,
ate nothing more than diejnnctive propoeitione combined with dilemmee. In
propoeing to exphin an effect, we commoneo with the enumeretlon ot the du·
ferent cnueee which eeem connected with its productim: then with the aid ot
one or more dilemma. we eliminate each οἱ the phenomena occidental to iu
communion, and conclude with attributing the effect to the meidue. For in·
etanoe, a certain phenomenon (a) ie produced either by phenomenon (n) or phe·
nomenon (o); but o cannot be the cauae of a, tor it ie iound in n, n, r, neithoe
ot which are connected with a. 'rhen the true caune of phenomenen (a) munt
be phenomenon (n).

Thie epeclee of maeoning {e liable to σανα-ιι perelogleme, egeinet which
Becon bne not gun-ded hie tendere, trem the very ieet that he etumbled into

defective enumeratione. Beoon, ln hie eurvey of the cenae· which are able
to concur in producing the phenenna ot the tidee‚ take· no account ot the

Bacon ie hardly Jnet or consistent in hie ceneune of Remum the end oi
vhoee dichotomy wan only to render reeeoning by dilemma. and crucht
·inetancee, more certain in ffielr reenlte, by reducing the divi-iona which
