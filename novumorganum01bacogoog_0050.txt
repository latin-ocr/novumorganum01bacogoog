desecte by substitutione, and falhoies by their correction.

⁸⁸ Boeotiis hardly correct in implying thet the memorationem per simplicem
was the only light in which the encients looked upon induction, es they appear
usto heve regarded it as only one, end thet the least importent, ot its species.
Arintotie expressly considers induction ίιι s perfect or dialectici sense, and in
ιιι impet-tect or rhetorical sense. Thus ii a genus (e), contains tour species
(Α, s, 0, n), the syllogiem would leod us to infer, thet what is true ot e, is
true ot any-one of the four. But perfect induction would resson, that wbst
we een prove of A, s, ο, n, seperstely, we may properly state es true ot e, the
whole genus. This is evidently s formal argument as demonstrative as the syl·
logism. In necessary mettere, however, legitimste induction mey elsim s wider

species. §neh ere those inductive interences which concern the lawe oi nature,
