are gmunded chiefly upon this, that the moon reflect- ‘the
sun’s ruys, and that light does not appear capable of being
reflected except by solide. 'Phe instances of the cross will
therefore (if. any) be such as to exhibit reflection by n rare
body, such as fleme, if it be but sufficietly dense. 'Nom
certainly, one os the reasons of twilight is the reflection⁸·
of the rays os the sun by the upper pert of the stmosphere.
We see the sun’s rays also reflected on fine evenings by
streaks of meist clouds, with s splendor not less, but per·
hnps more bright and glorious than that refiected from the
body of the moon, end yet it is not clear thet those clouds
heve formed into a dense body of water. We see, also, that
the dark nir behind the wind-owe at night reflecte the light,
oi a candle in the seme manner as n dense · body would. do.“
'Phe experiment should also bez-made of causing the sun’s
ruys to fall through s hole upon some dnrk and bluish
fiame. 'The unconfined ruys of the sun, when falling on
faint flames, do certainly appear to denden them, and render
them more like white smoke than flames. These are the
only instances which occur at present of the nature of those
of the oross, and better perhaps can be found. But it must
always be obser-ved that reflection is not to be expected
from fleme, unless it be oi some depth, for otherwise it be·

A sufficient proos ot the former is atlon-ded by the sttmctiou of the sea, and the
moon’s motion round the earth. -Εά,
