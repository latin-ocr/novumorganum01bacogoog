if it be granted thet the earth is fixed3 but if ,the earth
revolves, it may perhaps huppen, that· from the unequal
revolution (as regards veloeity) oi the earth and 'the waters
of the seu, there may be a violent forcing of the waters into
a mass, sorniing the flood, end a subseqnent relaxation of
them (when they eun no longer bear the accumulation),
forming the ebb. A separate inquii-y must be made into
this. Even with this hypothesin, however, it remeius
equally true, that there must be an ebb somewhere, at the
same time thet there is u flood in another querter.

Again, let the required nature be the latter oi the two
motions we have supposed3 namely, that oi a rising and
subsiding motion, if it should huppen that upon diligent
’ examination the progressive motion·be rejected. We have,
then, three ways before ue, with regerd to this nature. The
motion, by which the water-s raise themselves, end again
fall, back, in the floods end ebbs, without the addition -of
any other water rolled toward them, must take place in one
of ‘the three following ways: Either the supply oi water
emanates from, the ‚interior of the earth, and returns beck
agaim or there is really no greater quantity of water, but
the same water (without any augmentation ot its quantity)
is extended or rarefied, so as to oocupy a greater spaoe end
dimension‚ und again contracte itseli3 or there is neither en
additional supply nor any extension, but the same waters
(with regard to quantity, density, ‚or rarity) raise themselves
and fall from sympathy, by -some magnetio power attracting
and calling them up, as it were, from above. Let ns then
(passing over the first two motione) reduce, the investiga·
tion to the last, and inquire if there beeny sueh elevetion
of the water by sympathy or a magnetie ioree; and it is evi·
dent, in the first place, that the whole mass of water being .
