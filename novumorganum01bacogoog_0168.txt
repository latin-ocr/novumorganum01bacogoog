takes place more directly in the same than in different sub·
jects3 but if the form (as it is quite clear from what has
been advanced) exhibit itself in one subject, it leads ιο 811.
'l'he more simple the migration is, the more valuable is the
instance. 'I'hese migrating instances are, moreover‚ very

useful in practice, ior since they manifest the form, coupled ⁸

with that which causes sor destroys it, they point out the ¹

right practice in some subjecte, and thence there is an easy
transition ιο those with which they' are most allied. There
is, however, a degree of danger which demands cantion,
namely, lest they should refer the form too much ιο its
efficient cause, and imbue, or at least tinge, the understand·
ing with a false notion of the form from the appearance ci
such cause, which is never more than a vehicle or convey·

Let us then give an example of a migrating instance.
Let whiteness be the required nature. An instance which
pasees toward generation is glass in its entire and in its
powdered state, or water in its natural state, and when
agitated ιο froth3 for glass when entire, and water in its
natural state, are transparent and not white, but powdered
31888 and the iroth of water are white and not transparent.
We must inquire, therefore, what has happened to the glass
or water in the course oi this migration; for it is manifest
that the form of whiteness is conveyed and introduced by
the bruising of the glass and the agitation of the water3
but nothing is found ιο have been introduced but a dimin·
ishing of the parts of the glass and water and the insertion
cf air. Yet this is no slight progress toward discovering
