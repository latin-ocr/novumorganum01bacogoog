The third and fourth cases spply to many subjects, snd
the reduction ιο the sphere of the senses must be obtained

’ from every quarter in the investigationi of things. There

are many examples. It is obvious that air, and spirit, and

motion of the spirit inclosed in tangible bodies3 for every
tangible body with which we ere acquainted contains an
