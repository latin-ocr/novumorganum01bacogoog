of wine, which are lighter than oil, mix very well with
water. A very remarkable instance ot the motion in ques-
tion is seen in nin-e, and crude bodies of s like nature,
'which abhor flame, as may be observed in gunpowdet,
quicksilver and gold. The avoidance of one pole of the'
magnet by iron is not (as Gilbert has well observed),
strictly speaking, sn svoidsnce, but a conformity, or at·
traction to a more convenient situation.

Let the eleventh motion be that of assimilation, or selt-
multiplication, or simple generation, by which latter term
we do not mean the simple generation of integral bodie&
such as plante ot· animale, but of homogeneous bodies.

B y this motion homogeneous bodies convett those which ·

are allied to them, οι· at least well disposed and prepared,
into their own substance and nature. , Thus flame multi·
plies itself over vapore and. oily substances and generate·
fresh flame; the air over water and watery substances mul·
tiplies itself and genet-ates fresh ait-3 the vegetable and ani·
, mal spirit, over the thin particles of a watery οι· oleaginous
spirit contained in its food, multiplice itself and generate·
fresh spirit3 the solid parts of plante and animale, as the
leaf, flower, the fiesh, bone and the like, each of them
assimilate some part of the juices contained in their foed,
and generate ·a successive and daily substance. For let
none rave with Paracelsus, who (blinded by his distilla-
tions) would have it, that nutrition takes place by mere -
separation, and that the eye, nose, brain and liver lie con·
cealed in bread and meat, the root, leaf and fiower, in the
juice of the earth3 asserting that just as the artist brings·
out a leaf, flower, eye, nose, hand, foot and the like, from
a rude mass of stone or wood by the separation and rejec-
tion oi what is superfluous} ’ so- the great artist within us
