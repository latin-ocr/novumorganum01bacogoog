LX. 'l'he idols imposed upon the understanding by words

are of two kinds. 'I'hey are either the names of things which
have no existence (for as some obiecta are‘ from inattention
, left without a name, so names are formed by fancisul imagi-
natione which are without an object), or they are the names
of actual objecta, but confused, badly defined, and hastily

mum mobile, the planetu-y orbits‚'⁴ the eloinent of fire, and
the like fictione, which owe their birth to futile and false
theorice, are instances oi the first kind. And this species

vicione and unskiliul abstraction, are intricate and deeply

other point in the circle, and the planete were supposed to revolve in a emanet
circle (epicycle) round sn imaginat-y point, which in its turn described a circle
oi which the earth was the centre. In proportion as observation elicited fresh
tacte, contradictory to these representatione, other epicycIee and eccentrice
were added, involving additional confusion. ‘though Kepler had swept away all
