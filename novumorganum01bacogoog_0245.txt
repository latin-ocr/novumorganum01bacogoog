(as iar as regards any great difference between the true and
apparent time), was subsequently completely set at rest,
when we considered the infinite loss and diminution of
sizo as regards the real and apparent magnitude of &stan
occasioned by its distance, and at the same time observed
at how great a distance (at least sixty miles) bodies which
are merely white can be suddenly seen by us. For there
is no doubt, that the light of the heavenly bodies not only
far surpasses the vivid appearance ot white, but even the
light of any fleme (with which we are acquainted) in the
.vigor of its radiation. The immense velocity of the bodies
” themselves, which isperceived in their diurnal motion, and
has so astonished thinking men, that they have been more
ready to believe in the motion oi the earth, rendere the
motion of radiation from them (mai-vellens· as it is in its
rapidity) more worthy of belief. 'l'hat which has weighed
most with us, however, is, that if there were any consider·
able interval of time between the reality and the appear·
auce, the images would often be interrupted and confused
by clouds formed in the meantime, and similar disturb-
ances of the medium. Let this suffice with regard to the
simple mensures of time.

It is not merely the absolute, but still more the relative
measure of motione and actions which must be inquired
into, tor this latter is of great use and application. We
perceive that the fleme oi firearms is seen sooner thari the
sound is heard, although the ball must have struck the air
before the fleme, which was behind it, could escape: the
reason of which is, that light moves with greater velocity
