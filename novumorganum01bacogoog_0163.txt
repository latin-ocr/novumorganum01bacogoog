'l'he differenee of which we now spesk is oommon also
to the nature of oold, in whieh the eontrseting motion is
resti-sined by the resistanee of expansion, asin hest the ex·
pansive motion is restrsined by the resistanee of eontrmtion.

whether, therefore, the partieles of matter penetrate
inward or ontwsrd, the ressoning is the same, though the
, power be very different, because we heve nothing on earth
which is intensely eold.

IV. The fourth differ-enee is a modification ot the pre· ·

eeding, namely, that this stimulating or penetrating motion
should be rspid and never sluggish‚ sud should take plaoe
not in the very minutest partiales, but rather in those of
some tolerable dimensione.

’ It is shown by comparing the effeeu of fire with those
of time. Time dries, consumes, undermines, and reduces to
ashes as well as fire, end perhaps to a much finer degree3
but ss its motion is very slow, and attacks very minute
particles, no hest is pereeived.

It is also shown in a compsi-ison of the dissolution oi
iron and gold3 for gold is dissolved without the excitement
of any hest, but iron wit'h a vehement excitement of it,
although most in the same time, beosuse in the former the
'penetration of the separating aoid is mild, and gently in-
· sinuates itself, and the partiales of gold yield easily, but
the penetration of iron is violent, and attended with some
struggle, and its partiales are more obstinate.

It is partially shown, also, in some gangrenes and morti-
fications os flesh, which do not excite great hest or pain,
from the gentle nature of the putrefaction.

Let this suffice ior s first vintage, οι· the commenoement
of the interpretation of the form of hest by the liberty ot

the undet-standing.
