haic the two following cronnys with regnrd to this
nature:

'l'his momentu-y nature either crisos hom the cessation
of the cause which first produced it, ss in light, sounds, and
violent motione, ss they cre termed, or fleme may be cape·
ble, by its own nature, of duration, but is subjected to some
violence from the contrary natur-es which surround it, and
ia destroyed. “

We may therefore adopt the following instance of the
cross- We sec to · whst' a height the flames rise in great
conflsgmtions3 for ss the base oi the fleme becomes more
extensive, its vertex is more loity. It appears, then, that
the commencement of the extinction takes plsce at the
sides, where the flsmc is compressed by the sir, and is ill
ct ουκ but the centre oi the fleme, which is untouched by
the, air ancl surrounded by fleme, continues the same, and
is not extinguished until compressed by degrees by the sir
attacking it from the sides. All fleme, therefore, is pyra.-
midal, having its base near the source, and its vertex
pointed from its being resisted by the sir, and not sup·
plied from the source. On the contrary, the smoke, which
is nsrrow st the base, expande in its secent, and resembles
sn inverted pyramid, because the air admits the smoke, but
compressos the flam03 for let no one dream that the lighted
fleme is sir, since they sre clearly heterogeneous.

The instance of the cross will be more accurate, if the
'experiment can be made by flames of different colors.
'l'ske‚ therefore, a small metsl sconce, and place a lighted
tapei- in it, then put it in a basin, and pour a small quantity
oi spirits ot wine round the sconce‚ so as not to resch its
edge, and light the spirit. Now, the fleme oi the spirit will
be blue, ancl that oi the taper yellow3 observe, therefore,
