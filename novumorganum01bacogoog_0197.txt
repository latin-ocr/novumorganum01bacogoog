Agsin, let the required natm-es be motion end rest.
There appears to be a settled clessiflcetion. grounded on
the deepest philosophy, that natural bodies either revolve,
move in s straight line, or stand still end rest. For there
is either motion without Emit. or eontinusnce within a cer·
tsin limit, or s translation toward a certain limit. 'l'he eter-
nal motion of revolution appears peculisr to the heuvenly
bodies, rest to this our globe, end the other bodies (heevy
and light, as they ure tei-med, thet is to say, placed out of
their natural position) ere borne in a straight line‘to messes

or aggregatos which resemble them, the light toward the -

heaven, the hesvy toward the eerth3 end sll this is very
fine lengunge. .
But we have nn instance oi slliance in low comete, whioh

. revolve, though fer below the heevcns3 end the fiction of

Aristotle, of the comet being fixed to, or necmsdly fol·
lowing some ster, hes been long since exploded3 not only
because it is improbable in itself‚ but from the evident tect
of the discursive and irreguler motion ot comete through
various parts os the heavens.“ ’

Another instance of elliance is thet ot the motion of air,⁷
which appears to revolve from esst to west within the trop·
ios, where the circlos of revolution sre the greatest.

The flow and ebb of the sea would perhaps be another
instance, if the water were once found to heve a motion of
