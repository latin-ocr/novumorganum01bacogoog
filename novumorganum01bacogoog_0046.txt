is their meaning: if a body, unchanged in other respects, is
moved from its,- place, this is translation ,⁶ if the place and
species be given, but the quantity changed, it is alteration ξ

body do not continue the same, this is the motion of a—ug3

to vary the species and substance, and transfuse them to
others, this is generation and corruption. All this is merely '
popular, and by no means penetrates into nature3 and these
are but the messuros and bounds of motion, and not differ-

nor the process of their parts, but merely establish a divi·
