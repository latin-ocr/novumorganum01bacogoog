'Phe confinement of the motion of lenset congregation,
whioh arinen from externas motion, is very evident in that
agitation of bodies which presel-veo them from putreteotion.
For all putrefaction depende on the congregation of the
homogeneons parte, whence, by degreee, there eneuee n
eorrnption of the first torm (ee it in called), and the gen·
oration of another. For the deoomp'oeit'ion of the original
form, which ie iteelf the nnion ot the homogeneone perte,
precedes the putrefaction, which properes the way sor the
generat-ion ot another. 'ruis deoomposition, if not inter·

agitation be exeited by extol-nel motion, the motion toward
anion (which ie delicate and gentle, end requires to be free
hom all external influenoe) ie disturbed, and oeaeee3 which
