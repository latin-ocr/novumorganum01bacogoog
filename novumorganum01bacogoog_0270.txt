nature, pursning‘ themselves and nothing else, and seek·
ing, as it were, to embrace themselves. For bodies seem
either to move without any limit, or ιο tend toward a limit,
arrived at which they either revolve according ιο their
peculial: nature, or rest. 'Phose which are favorably situ·

an eternal and unlimited motion3 those which are favor·

not favorably situated move in a straight line (as their
shortest path), in order ιο unite with others oi a congenial
nature. This motion of revelation admits of nine differ·

4, the velocity, or greater or less speed with which they
revolve3 5, the direction of the motion as from east to
west, or the reverse; 6, the deviation from a= perfect circle,
by spiral lines at a greater or.less distance from the centre3
7, the deviation from the circle, by spiral lines at a greater
or less distance from the poles3 8, the greater or less dis·

variation of the poles if they be movable; which, however,

considered to be that of the heavenly bodies. There ex·

more reasonable controversy, perhaps, exista (if it be not a
matter beyond-dispute), whether the motion in question (on
