or in destroying the orgnnic body-and those qualitiee, which
coneist entirely in motion (for all life, and every description
of fleme· and ignition nte destroyed by compression, which ,

those qualities which conciet in position and a coel-ee differ-

it becomes perceptibly more eweet. But ench violence ie of
