powerful motion. With regard to the first, heat is, on this
account, defined as that which separates heterogeneous, and
draws together homogeneous substances3 a definition of
the Peripatetics which is justly ridiculed by Gilbert, who
says it is as if one were to define man to be that which
sows wheat and plante vineyards3 being only a definit-ion
deduced from effecte, and those but partial. But it is still
more to be blamed, because those effects, such as they are,
are not a peculiar property of beat, but a mere accident (for
cold, as we shall after-ward show, does the same), arising
from the desire of the homogeneous parts to unite; the
beat then assists thein in breaking through that slnggish-
ness which before restrained their desire. With regard to “
the assistance derived from the power of a similar body, it
is most conspicuous in the magnet when armed with steel,
for it excites in the steel a power of adhering to steel, as a
homogeneous substance, the power of the magnet breaking
through the slnggishness of the steel. With regard to the
assistance oi motion, it is seen in wooden arrows or points,
which penetrate more deeply into wood than if they were
tipped with iron, from the similarity oi the substance, the
swiftness of the motion breaking through the sluggishness
of the wood3 of which two last experimenta we have spoken
above in the aphorism on clandestine instances.⁸⁴

'rho confinement of the motion of lesser congregation,
which arises from the power of the predominant body, is
shown in the decomposition of blood and urine by cold.
For as long as these substances are filled with the active
spirit, which regulates and restrains each of their component
parts, as the predominant ruler of the whole, the several
