and 1 remember having heard of some bottles of wine being
let down into a deep well in order to oool them, but left

bodies should be snnk to the bot-tom of water, as in rivers
or the sea, and yet should not touch the water, nor be in·

hollow tub ot metal was formed, ond sunk eo aa to have im
bottom parallel with the suriaco of the water-3 it thus carried

down with it to the bottomof the >eea all the nir contained ·

in the tub. It stood ,upon three feet (like a tripod), being
of rather less height then a man, so that, when the diver
was in want of brenth, he could put his head into the
hollow of the tub, brenthe, and then eontinue his work.
