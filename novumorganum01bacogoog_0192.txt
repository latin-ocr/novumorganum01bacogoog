XXXIII. In the eleventh rank oi prerogative instances
ve will place accompanying and hostile instancee. 'l'heee
are such ae exhibit any body or concrete, where the required
nature ie constantly' found, ee an inseparable companion,
or, on the contrary, where the required nature is constantly

avoided, end excluded from attendance, ae an enemy. From · ·

these instancee may be formed certain and universal propo·
sitione, either affirmative or negative; the subject oi which
will be the concrete body, and the predicate the required
nature. Ι E'or particular propositione are by no means fixed,
when the required nature ie found to fluctuate and change
in the concrete, either approaching and acquired, or reced-
ing and laid aeide. Hence particular propositione have no
great prerogative, except in the case of migration, of which
we have spoken above. Yet such particular propositione
are of great use, when compared with the universal, ee wiu
be mentioned in its proper place. Nor do we require abso·
lute affirmation or negation, even in universal propositione,
for if the exceptione be singular or rare, it ie sufficient for

- our purpose.

'I'he use oi accompanying instances is to narrow the
affirmative of form3 tor as it ie narrowed by the migrating
inetaneos, where the form must necessarily be something
communicated or destroyed by the act of migration‚ eo it is
narrowed by accompanying instances, where the form must
necessarily be something which enters into the concretion
of the body, or, on the contrary, is repugnant to it; and
one who is well acquainted with the constitution or forma·
tion of the body, will not be iar from bringing to light the
form of 'the required nature.
