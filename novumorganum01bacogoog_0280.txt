It might readily have been attempted (it we had but thought ·
oi it), w'hen we condensed water (as was mentioned above),
by hammer-ing and compression, until it burst out. For we
ought ιο have leit the flattened globe untouched for some

·. days, and then ιο have drawn off the water, in order ιο

try whether it would have immediateljr occupied the same
dimensione aa it did before the condensation. It it had not
done so, either immediately, or soon afterward‚ the conden-
, sation would 'have appeared ιο have been rendered constant3
it not, it would have appeared that a restitution took place,
and that-the condensation had been transitory. Something
οι the sama kind might have been tried with the glass egg„
the egg should have been sealed up suddenly and firmly,
aiter a complete exhaustion of the air, and should have been
allowed to remain so for some days, and it might then have
been tried whether, on opening the aperture, the ‘air would
be drawn in with a hissing noise, or whether as much water
would be drawn into it when immersed, as would have been
drawn into it at first, ii it had not continued sealed. For
it is probable (or, at least, worth making the experiment)
that this might have happened, or might happen‚ because
