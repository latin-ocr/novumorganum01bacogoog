external mov-ing cause, and imposed innumerable arbitrary
distinctions upon the nature of things; being everywhere
more anxious as to definitione in teaching and the accuracy

of the wording of his propositione, than the internal truth
of things. And this is best shown by a compar-ison of his
philosophy with the others of greatest repnte among the
Greeks. For the similar parte of Anaxagoras, the atoma
of Le‘ncippus and Democritus, the heaven and earth of Pars

lution of bodies into the common nature of fire, and their
condensation according to Heraclitus, exhibit some sprink-
ling of natural philosophy, the nature of things, and experi-

¹1¹ ment3 while Aristotle's physice are mere logical terms, and
he remodelled the ‚same subject in his metaphysica under a

axioms, and after having so decided, he drage experiment
