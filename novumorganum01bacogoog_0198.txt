revolution, though slov and hardly perceptible, from east
to west, subject, however, to a reaction twice a day. 11
this be so, it is clear that the motion of revolution is not
confined to the celestial bodies, but is ahai-ed, also, by air
aud water..
· Again-the supposed peculiat- disposition of light bodies
to rise is rather shaken3 and here we may find an instance
of alliauce in a water bubble. For it air be placed under
mater, it rises rapidly toward the surface by that striking
motion (as Democritus terme it) with which the descending
water strikes the air and raises it, not by any struggle or
effert of the air itself3 and when it has reached the surface
of the water, it is prevented from ascending any further, by
the slight resistance it meets with in the water, which does
not allow an immediate separation -of its parta, so that the
tendency oi the air to rise must be very slight.

Agma, let the required nature be wcight. It is certainly
a received classiflcation', that dense and. solid bodies are
borne toward the centro of the earth, and rare and light
bodies to the circumference of the homene, as their appro-
priate places. As far as relatos to places (though these
things have much weight in the schools)‚ the notion of
there being any determinate place is absurd and puerile.
Philosophers trifle, therefore, when they tell you, that if
the earth were perforated, heavy bodies would stop on their
arrival at th'e centre. This centre would indeed be an effi·
cacious nothing, or mathematical point, could it affect
bodies or be sought by them, for a body is not acted upon
except by a body.⁸⁸ In fact, this tendency to ascend and
