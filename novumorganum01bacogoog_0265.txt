Lot tho twelfth motion bc that of cxcitancnt, which
appears to bc a specics ot the last, and is sometimes men·
tioncd by ns under that name. It is, like that, a diffu-
sive, communicative, transitive and multiplying motion3
and they agree remarkably in their effect, although thoy
differ in their mode of action, and in their subject matter.
'Phe former proceeds imperiously and with authority3 it
orders and compcls the assimilatcd to bc converted and
changed into the assimilating body. 'I'hc latter proceeds
by art, insinuation and stcslth‚‘ inviting and disposing the
