XLVII. In the twenty-third rank of prerogativa in·
atancea we will place instancee of quantity, which we are
aleo wont. to call the doeea of nature (bon-owing a word
from medicine). They are such aa measure the powers by
the quantity oi bodies, and point out the effect ot the quan·
tity in the degree of power. And in the first place, some
powers only subsint in the universal quantity, or auch ae
beara a relation to the confirmation and ⁴fabric oi the uni·
verae. 'Phua the earth ie fixed‚ ita parta fall. The watera
in the sea flow and ebb, but not in the rivere. except by the
admission of the eea. Thea, again, almost all particular
powers act according to the greater or leae quantity of the
body. Large manses cf water are not easily rendered foul,
small are. N ew wine and beer become ripe and drinkable
in small ekina much more readily than in large caake. Is a
' herb be placed in a considerable quantity of liquid, iniueion
'takes place rather than impregnatiom if in lesa, the reverse.
A bath, therefore, and a light aprinkling, produce different
ffiflects on the human body. Light dew, again, never talla, ’
σῶαι is dissipated and incorporated with the aii-3 thus we see
that in breathing on geme, the slight quantity of moisture‚
like a small cloud in the air, is immediately dissolved.
Again, a piece of the earne magnet does not attract eo much
iron as the whole magnet did. There are aome powers
*where the smannens of the quantity is of more avai13 ae in
boring, a sharp point piercee more readily than a blunt one;
the diamond‚ when pointed, makes an impression on glaee,
and the like.
’ Here, too, we muat not reat contented with a vague
⁴1·e·ault,but inquire into the exact proportion of quantity
‘requisito for a particular exer-tion of power3 ior one would

be apt to suppone that the power beare an exact proportion
