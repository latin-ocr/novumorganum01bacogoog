- But this differenee is chiefly shown in flame and boiling
liquide, which always hun-y, ewen, and subside again in de·
taohed parts.

- It is also shown in bodies of such hard texture ae not
to swell or dilate in bulk, such ae red-hot iren, in which
the heat is most violent.

It is aleo shown by the flree burning most briskly in the
eoldeet weather.

It ia alno shown by this, that when the air is dilated in
the thermometer unitormly and equably, without any im-
pediment or repulsion‚ the heat is not perceptible. In oon·
fined draughta aleo, although they break out very violently‚
“no remarkable heat is pereeived‚ because the motion affecta
the whole, without any alternating motion in the particlea3
for which reason try whether fleme do not burn more at the
sides than in ita oentre. ι

It is also shown in this, that all burning proceeds by
the minute poree of bodies—undertniniug‚ penetrating‚
pieroing, and prieking them aa ii with an infinite number
of medlo-points. Henee all strong aeide (if adapted to the
body on which they aot) exhibit the effecte of flre, from
their eorroding and pungent nature.
