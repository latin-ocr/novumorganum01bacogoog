ceived by the sight with greater rapidity than they are dis-
missed, and for this reason, a violin string touched with the
finger appears double or triple, because the new image is
received before the former one is dismissed. Hence, also,
rings when spinning appear globular, and a lighted torch,
borne rapidly along at night, appears to have a tail. Upon
the principle oi the inequality oi motion, also, Galileo at·
tempted an explanation oi the flood and ebb of the sea,
supposing the earth to move rapidly, and the water slowly,
by which means the water, after accumulating, would at
intervals fall back, as is shown in a vessel oi water made
to move rapidly. He has, however, imagined ‘this on data
which cannot be granted (namely, the earth’s motion), and .
besides, does not satisfactorily account for the tide taking
place every six hours.

An example of our present point (the relative measure
of motion), and, at the same time, oi its remarkable use of
which we have spoken, is conspicuous in mines filled‘with
gunpowder, where immense weights oi earth, buildings,
and the like, are overthrown and prostrated by a small
quantity oi powder3 the reason of which is decidedly this,
that the motion oi the expansion oi the gunpowder is much
more rapid than that of gravity,'⁸ which would resistit, so
that the former has terminated before the latter has com·
menced. Hence, also, in missiles, a strong blow will not
carry them so iar as a sharp and rapid one. Nor could a
