NOVUM ORGANUR 211·

grees and distances. There is, therefore, some one moment
of time and some interval of space, in which the power or
action is suspended between the two bodies creating the mo· “
tion. Our consideration, then, is reduced to this, whether
the bodies which are the extremes of motion prepare or alter
the intermediam bodies, so that the power advances from
one extreme to the other by succession and actual contact,
andin the meantime existe in some intermediate body; or
whether there existe insreality nothing but the bodies, the
power, and the space? ln the case of the rays oi light,
sounds, and heat, and some other objects which operate at
a distance, it is indeed probable that the intermediate
bodies are prepared and altered, the more so because a
qualified medium is required for their operation. But the

magnetic or attractive power admits oi an indifferent me· ·

dium, and it is not impeded in any. But is that power or
action is independent oi the intermediate body, it follows
that it is a natural power or action existing in a certain time
and space without any body, since it existe neither in the
extreme ·nor in the inter-mediate bodies. Hence the mag·
netic action may be taken as an instance of divorce of cor·
poreal nature and natural action; to which we may add, as
a corollary aud an advantage not to be neglected, that it
may be taken as a proof of essence and substance being
separate and incorporeal, even by those who philosophiae
according to the senses. For if natural power and action
emanating from a body can exist at any time and place
entirely without any body, it is nearly a proof that it can
‘also emanate originally from an incorporeal substance; ior
a corporeal nature appears to be no less necessary for sup.-
porting and conveying, ,than for exciting or generating nat·
usal action.
