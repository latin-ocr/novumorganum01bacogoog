although they be not of much assistance in discovering
forms, yet they are οι great advantage in disclosing the
frume of parts of the universe, upon whose members they
practice a species oi anatomy, and thence occasionally lead

’ us gently on to sublime snd noble axioms, especially such

as relate to the construction of the world, rather than to
simple natures and forms„

As an example, take the following similar instances: a
mix-ror and the 0503 the formation of the ear, and places

which return an echo. From such similarity, besides ob· ,

serving the resemblance (which is useiul for many pur·
poses), it is easy to collect and form this axiom. 'I'hat
the organs of the senses, and bodies which produce reflec-
tione to the sennes, are of a similar nature. Again, the
undet-standing once informed oi this, risos easily to a higher
and nobler axiom3 namely, that the only distinction between
sensitive and inanimato bodies, in those points in which
they agree and sympathize, is this: in the former, animal
spirit is added to the arrangement oi the body, in the latter
it is wanting. So that there might be as many senses in
animale as there are points of agreement with inanimato
bodies, it the animated body were perforated, so as to allow
the spirit to have access to the limb properly disposed ior
action, as a fit organ. And, on the other hand, there are,
without doubt, as many motione in an inanimate as there
are senses in the animated body, though the animal spirit
be absent. 'I'here must, however, be many more motione
in inanimate bodies than senses in the animated, from the
small number of organs of sense. A very plain example
of this is afforded by paine. For, as animale are liable to
-many kinds and various descriptione of paine (such as those
of burning, of intense cold, of pricking, squeezing, stretch·
