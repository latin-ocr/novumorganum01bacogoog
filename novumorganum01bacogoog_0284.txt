exemplified in induration by fite, and the repented heating
and extinguishing of metals, and the like. 8. By the
oohesion of tho most solid homogeneous parts ot a given
body, whioh were previously separated, and mixed with

its simple state, in which it oooupies much less space than
it did in powder, and the same may be observed ot the
oleansing ot all metsls from their dross. 4. By hermony,

latent power. These harmonies· are as yet but rarely ob·
sel-ved, at which we cannot be surprised, since thet-e is little
to hope for hom their investigation, unless the discovery of
' forms and confirmation be attained. With regard to ani·
mal bodies, it is not to be questioned that there are many

ν intel-nal and external medicines which condense by har·

mony, as we have before observed, bnt this aetion is rare
in inanimato bodies. Written accounts, as well as report,
have certainly spoken of a tree in one of the 'Pet-cera or
Oanary Islnnds (for Ι do not exaotly reoolieet which) thet
drips perpetually, so as to supply the inhabitants, in some

ros solis is filled with dew at noon, while the sun gives out
its greatest heat, and all other herbs around it are dry.. 'We
treet both these accounts as fables;' they would, however, it ·
true, be of the most important service, and most worthy of
examination. As to the honey·dew, resembling manna,
which is found in May on the leaves of the oak,‚we are of
opinion that it is not condensed by anyharmony or peculi-
