said above, concerning the extending of natural philosophy

which we cannot hope to advance.

cvm. Such are the observations we would make in
order to remove despair and excite hope, by hidding fare·
well to the errors ot past ages, or by their correction. Let
us examine whether there be other grounds ior hope. And,
first, if many useful discoveries have occurred to mankind
