Une First Vintaqe of the For-m of Heat

It must be observed that the form of anything is inherent
(as appears clearly from our promises) in each individual in·
stance in which the thing itself is inherent, or it would not
be a form. No contradictory instance, therefore, can be al·
leged. 'Phe form, however, is found to be much more con·
spicuous· and evident in some instances than in others3 in
those (for example) where its nature is less restrained and
embarrassed, and reduced to rule by other natur-es. Such
instances we are wont to term coruscations² or conspicuous
instances. We must proceed, then„ to the first vintage of
’ the form of heat.

From the instances taken collectively, as well as singly,
the nature whose limit is heat appears to be motion. This
is chiefly exhibited in flame, which is in constant motion, Ι
and in warm or boiling liquide, which ure likewise in con·
stant motion. It is also showuiu the excitement or increase
of heat byvmotion, as by bellows and draughts: for which
see Inst. 29, Tab. 3, and by other species of motion, as in
lnst. 28 and 31, Tab. 3. It is also shown by the extinction
of fire and heat upon any strong pressure, which resti-ains
and puts a stop to motion3 for which see Iust. 30 and 32,
Tab. 3. Itis further shown by this circumstance, namely,
that every substance is destroyed, or at least materially
changed, by strong and powerful fire and heat: whence it is
clear that tumult and confusion are occasioned by heat, to·
gether with a violent motion in the internal parts of bodies3
and this gradually tends to their dissolution.

What we have said with regard to motion must be thus
