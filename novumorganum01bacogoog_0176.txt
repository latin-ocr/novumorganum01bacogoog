memoryt topios or eommonplaees in artifieial memory,
which may be either places in their literal sense, as a gato,
a corner, a window‚ aud the like, or familiar persons and
ἀυτὴ, οι· anything else (provided it be arranged in a deter-
minate order), as animale, plants‚ and words, letters, ehar-
actore, historioal persons, and the like, oi which, however,
some are more eonvenient than. others. All these common·
places materially assist memory, and raise it far above its
natural strength. Verse, too, is recolleeted and learned
more easily than prose. From this group of three instanoes

may be well termed a separation from infinity. For when
a man strives to reeolleet or recall anything to mentem, “
without a preconeeived notion or perception of the objeot
of his search, he inquires about, and labors, and turns from
point to point, as if involved in infinity. But if he have
any preconeeived notion‚ this infinity is separated off, and
the range of his memory is brought within eloser limits.
In the three instanoes given above, the preconeeived notion
is clear and determined. In the first, it must be something
that agrees with order; in the second, an image whioh has
some relation or agreement with the fixed eommouplaces3
in the third, words which fall into a verse: and thus infinity
is divided off. Other instanees will offer another speeies,
