the other systems of the ancients ceased and became obso-
lete on its promulgation, and nothing better, has been since

and founded, as to bave united the suffrages oi both ages}
we will obsone-1553 That the notion of other ancient sys-
tems having ceased after the publication of the works of
Aristotle is false, for the works of the ancient philosopher·
subsisted long aiter that event, even to the time of Cicero,
and the subsequent ages. But at a later period, when
