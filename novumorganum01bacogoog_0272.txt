in a variety of ways to motion. But if they be compelled
ιο move, . yet do they always appear anxious to reco ver

their former state, and ιο ceaee from motion, in which re· .

spect they certainly appear active, and attempt it with suffi-
cient sviftnesa and rapidity, as if fatigued, and impatie‘nt
of delay. We can only have a partial representation ot
this teudency, because with us every tangible substance is
not only not condensed ιο the utmost, but even some spirit
is added, owing ιο the action and connecting influence :01
the heavenly bodies.

We have now, therefore, exhibited the species, or sim·
ple elementa ol the motione, tendencies, and active powers,
which are most universal in nature; and no small portion
of natural science has been thus sketched out. We do not,

· however, deny that other instances can perhaps be added,

and our divisione changed according to some more natural
order oi things, and also reduced to a less number3 in wtst :h
respect we do not allude to any abstract classification, as it
one were to say, that bodies desire the preservation, ext-l·

= tation, propagation, or truition of their nature3 or, that

motion tends to the preservation and beneflt either of the
universe (as in the case of those of resistance and coum-c·
tion), or oi extensive wholes, as in the case of those of the
greater congregation, revolution, and abhorrence ot motion,
or oi particular forms, ab in the case of the others. ἱ ι·
although such remarks be just, yet, unless they termina-e
‘ in ‘matter and construction, according to true definitions,
they are speculative, and oi little use. In the meantime,
our classification will suffice, and be of much use in the
consideration of the predominance ol powers, and exam'

ing the wrestling instances which constitute our presens
subject.
