a. spring, end let them be set well together, so that one be
, neither quicker nor slower than the other; then let the 'clock
moved by weights be placed on the top· of a very high
church, and the other be kept below, end let it be well
observed‚ is the former move slower thau it did, from the
diminished power of the weights. Let the same experiment

j . be made at the bottom of mines worked ιο a considerable

depth, in order to see whether the clock move more quickly
from the increesed power oi the weights. But it this power
be found to diminish at e height, and ιο increase in subter·
rsueous places, the etti-action of the corpor-eal mass of the
earth may be taken as the cause of weight.

Again‚ let the required nature be the polarity of the
steel needle when touched with the magnet. We heve these
two ways with regard to this nature—Either the touch oi
the megnet must communicate polarity to the steel toward
the north and south, or else it may only excite and prepare
it, while the actual motion is occasioned by the presence
of the earth, which Gilbert considers to be the case, and
endeavors to prove with so much labor. The particulars
he has iuquired into with such ingenious zeal amount to
this—l. An iron bolt placed for‘a long time toward the

. north and south acquires polarity from this habit, without

the touch of the unguet, as if the earth itself operating but
weakly from its distance (for the surface or outer crust of
the earth does not, in his opinion, possess the magnetic
power), yet, by long continued motion, could supply the
place oi the magnet‚ excite* the iron, and convert and change
it when excited. 2. Iron, at a red or white heat, when

posing consequences οἱ the two theol-ies were noted by M. Fresnel, end the
result is stated by him ιο be decisivo iu favor of that theory which makes light
ιο cousist in the vibratione oi en elutic medium—Ed.
