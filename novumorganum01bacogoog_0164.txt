hom this first vintage the form οι· true definition of heat
(considered relatively to the universe and not ιο the sense)
is briefly thus-—Heat is an expansive motion restrained, and
seiving ιο exert itselt in the muller pon-fiola* 'l'he ex·
pansion is modified by its tendency ιο rise, though expand-
ing toward the extet-ion and the effert is modified by its not
being sluggish, but active and somewhat violent.

With regat-d ιο the operative definition, the matter is the
same. 11 you are able ιο excite a dilating or expansive
motion in any natural body, and so to repress that motion
and force it on itself ss not ιο allow the expansion ιο pro·

 

ceed equally, but-only ιο be partially exer-ted and partially ’

repressed, you will beyond all doubt produce hest, without
an y consideration as ιο whether the body be of earth (or
elementary, as they term it), οι· imbued with celestial in·
daenes, luminous or opaque, rare or dense, locally expanded

⁸⁸ Baeon's inquisition into the nature ot hest, as an example of the mode et
interpreting nature, cannot be looked upon otherwise than ss a complete failure.
'l'hough the exact nature oi this phenomenon is still an obscure and contro·
varied matter, the scienee ot thermotics now consiste ot many important trutina,
and to none οί these truths is there so much as an approximation in Becon’s
process. The steps by which this science really advanced were the discovery
ol a mensure ol a heat or temperatum, the establishment of the laws of con-
duction and radiation, ot the laws ot specific hest, latent heat, and the like.
Such advances have led ιο Ampere’s hypothesis, that hest consiste iu the vibre-
tions ot an impendet-able fluid3 and to Laplace's theory, that temperature cou-
sists in the intes-nal radiation of a similar medium. These hypotheses cannot
yet be said to be even probabis, but at least they are so modifled as ιο include
some ot the preceding lawe which are flrmly established, whereas Bacon’s
“form” or true definition ot beat, ss stated in the text, includes no lsws ot
pheuomena, explains no process, aud is indeed itseli an example of illicit gen·
eralization.

In all the details of his example of heat he is unfortunate. He includes in
his collection of instanees, the hot testes οἱ aromatic plante, the caustis effect·
oi acide, and many-other facts which cannot be ascribed to hest without a stu·
dions laxity in the use os the word—Ed.
