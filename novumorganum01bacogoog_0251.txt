This motion is designated by the schools (which generally
name and define everything by its effecte and inconven-
iences rather then by its inherent cauce) by the-axiom‚ thet
two bodies cannot exist in the same place, or they call it a
motion to prevent the penetration of dimensione. It is usc-
lees to give exemplos of this motion, since it exista in
every body.

Lot the second motion be that which we term the motion
of connection, by which bodies do not allow themselves to
be separated at any point from the contact of another body,
delighting‚ as it were, in the mutual connection and oontact.
This is called by the schools a motion to prevent a vacuum.
It takes place when water is drawn up by suction or c
sminge, the flesh by cupping, or when the water remeius
without escaping from perforated iare, unless the mouth be
opened to admit the air, and innumerable instancee of a like
Lot the third be that which we term the motion of lib·
erty, by which bodies sti-ive to deliver themselves from any,
unnatural pressure or tension, and to restore themselves· to
the dimensione suited to their mass3 and of which, also,
there are innumerable exemplos. Thus, we have exemplos
of their escaping from pressure, in the water in ewimming,
in the air in flying, in the water again in rowing, and in the
air in the undulation of the winde, and in springs of
watche& An exact instance of the motion oi compressed
air ie seen in children's popgune‚ which they make by
scooping out elder-branchos or *some such matter, and
forcing in a piece of some pulpy root or the like, at ecch
end3 then they force the root or other pellet with a rami-od
to the opposite end, from which the lower pellet is omitted
and proJ‘ected with a report, and that before it ie touched
