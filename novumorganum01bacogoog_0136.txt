however, true tm ‚oily substancee are rather less cold to
the touch than thone that are equeonn, oil for instance than
water, silk than linem but thie belongs to the table of de·
grece ot cold. ·

In like manner we may enbjoin a negative instance to
thet oi verm vapor, derived from the nature of vapor itself,
ae fer aa we are acquainted with it. For exhalatione from
oily substancee, though easily inflammeble, are yet never
wax-m unless recently exhaled from some verm substance.

'Phe same may be said oi the instance of εἰη for we
never perceive that nir ie warm unless confined or premoti,
or manifestly heated by the eun, by fires or some other
wal-m body.

A negative instance ie exhibited in weather by ite cold-
ness with an east or north wind, beyond what the season

A negative instance ae to air confined in caverna may be
obeerved in summer. Indeed‚ we should make n more dili·

place the qualities oi air in its own nature with regnrd to
