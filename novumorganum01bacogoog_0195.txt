tled and admitted3 and these kinds ot hest, especially one
of them compared with the other two, are supposed to be
different, and clearly heteregeneous in their essenee and
species, or specific nature, since the hest oi the heavenly
bodies and of animala generates and cherishes, while that
of flre corrupts and desnoys. ·We have an instance ‚ot
allianee, then, in a very common experiment, that of a
vine branch admitted into a building where there is a con·
stant fite, by which the grapes ripen a whole month sooner
than in the air3 so that fruit upon the tree can be ripened ⁵
by fire, although this appear the peculiar effect of the
sun. From this beginning, therefore, the undet-standing
rejects all essential differ-enee, and easily ascende tc the
investigation oi the real differences between the heat of
the sun and that of fire, by which their operation is
rendered dissimilar, although they pai-take of a common
nature. . , - · ,

‘rhene differences will be found to ,be four in number.
1. 'Phe hest of the snn is much milder and gentler in degree

than that of fire. 2. It is much more meist in quality, ,

especially as it is transmitted tc us through the air. 3.
Which is the chief point, it is very unequal, advancing and
increased at one time, retiring and diminished at another,
which mainly contributes to the generationi of bodies. For
Arist-ctis rightly asserted, that the principal cause of gen·

oblique path oi the sun in the zodiac, whence its heat be·
comes very unequal, partly from the alternatim of night

and day, partly from the successicn of summer and wimer.— .

Yet must he immediately corrupt and per-vert his discovery,
by dictating to nature according to his habit, and dogmati÷
