⁸⁰ The expet-{ments ot the lut tvo classes ot instsnces sre considered only
in relation ιο practice, end Bsoon does not ιο much as mention their Infinitely
‘reem importune· in the theon-etim pert ot induction. 'l'he importent law d
ςηνίιιιὶοιι in physionl astronomy oould never heve been demonstrem but by
ench observatione end experiments ss assigned secun-ste geometria} mensures
to the quantiae· comp-ted. It πω necessary to determine with precision the
demi-diameter ot the est-th, the velocity οί tslling bodies st its numne, the dis·
tsnee of the moon, snd the spesd with which she describes her orbit, before
the relation oould be discovered between the lotoe which dnvs s stone to the
ground end that which retains tho moon in her sphere.

In many ωσι the result ot s number ot particular fsots, or the collective -
instsnoes rising out ot them, oen only bo discovered by gnomen-y, which so fit
&eomes neossssry to oomplete the work ot induet-ion. For munos, in the
osse ot opttos, when light pessos from one trsnspsrent medinm to another, it
is retmcted, snd the angle which the rsy oi incidence makes with the supet·
nese· which bonnas the two media determine· mu which the ωιηῖιοα ray
mskes with the seme superficies. Now, nu expet-{ment osn do tor ns in this
osse is, to determine tor any particule!- angle of incidenoe the correspondinss
angle oi retrsetion. But with respect to the general mle which in every pos-
enno osse deduces one σί these angles from the other, οι· expresses the constent
snd invarisblo relation which subsiste between them, experiment gives no direct
insol-motion. Geometry must, oonsequen tly, be oslled in, which, when s eo ·

flon either soonrstely or by sppmximntion. In this way it has been found,
when the two medis romain the asmo, the oosines of the above-mentioned
angles heve s constant rstio to esch other. Honos, when the relations ot the
simple elementa ot phenomens ere discovered to mord s general mle which
vm epply to sny concrete esse, the deductim method must be applied, end the
elementsry principles made thsough its egenos to eooount tor the lsws ot their
more complex combinations. Tho reflection end retraction ot light by the τοίη
ming from s cloud opposite to the sun was thought, even before Nemon’s
