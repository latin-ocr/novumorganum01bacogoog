, ‘Phe accumulation ot matter, however, and its relative
quantity, are rendered sensible by weight3 for weight is
proportionate to the quantity of matter, as regards the parts

of a tangible substance, but spirit and its quantity of mat· ·

ter are not to be computed by weight, which spirit rather

' diminishes than augmenta.

We have made a tolerably accurate table of weight, in
which we have selected the weights and aize of all the
metals, the principal minerals, stones, liquide, oils, and
many other natural and artificial bodies: a very usefnl pro·
ceeding both aa regards theory and practice, and which is
capable of revealing many unexpected results. Nor is this
of little consequence, that it serves to demonstrate that the
whole range of the variety of tangible bodies with which
we are acquainted (we mean tolerably close, and not
spongy, hollow bodies, which are -for a considerable part

filled with air), does not exceed the ratio of one to twenty· ·

one. So limited is nature, or at least that part of it to
which we are most habituated.

'We have also thought it deserving our industry, to try
ii we could ari-ive at the ratio ot intangible or pneumatio
bodies to tangible bodies, which we attempted by the fol·
lowing contrivance. We took a vial capable of containing
about an ounce, using a small vessel in order to effect the
subsequent evaporation with less' heat- We filled this vial,
almost to the neck, with spirits oi wine, selecting it as the
tangible body which, by our table, was the rarest, and con·
tained a less quantity of matter in a given space than all
other tangible bodies which are compact and¹ not hollow.
'rhen we noted exactly the weight of the liquid and vial.
We next took a bladder, containing about two pints, and
squeezed all the air out ot it, as completely as possible, and
