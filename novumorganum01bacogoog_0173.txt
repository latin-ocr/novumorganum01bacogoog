by the interpositiou oi 'the air, as to admit oi being throvn
some little distance without bursting. 'l'he best example is
that ot iroth and σοον, which assume such consistency as
almost to admit ot being cut, although composed of air and
water, both liquide. All these circumstances clearly show

that the terms liquid and consistent are merely vulgar no· ,

tiens adapted to the sense, aud that in reality all bodies have
a tendenoy to avoid a breach of continuity, faint sud· real:
in bodies composed oi homogeneous parts (as is the case with
liquida), but more vivid and poweriul in those composed of
heterogeneous parts, because the approach of heterogeneous
matter binde bodies together, while the insinuation oi homo«

- geneous matter loosens and relaxes them.

Again, to take another example, let the required nature
be attraction or the cohesion oi bodies. 'Phe most remark·
able conspicuous instance with regard to its form is the mag·
net. 'Phe contrary nature to attraction is non-attraction‚
though in a similar substance. 'l'hus iron does not attract

iron, lead lead, wood wood‚ nor water water. But the clan- .

destine instance is that of the magnet armed with iron, or
rather that of iron in the magnet so armed. For its nature
is such that the magnet when armed does not.attract iron
more powerfully at any given distance than when unarmed3
but if the iron be brought in contact with the armed magnet,
the latter will sustain a much greater weight than the simple
magnet, from the· resemblance ot substance in the two por·
tions of iren, a quality altogether clandestine and hidden in
the iron until the magnet was introduced. ·It is manifest,

· therefore, that the form of cohesion is something which is

vivid and robust in the magnet‚ and hidden and weak in the
iron. It is to be observed, also, that small wooden arrows
without an iron point, when discharged from large morters,
