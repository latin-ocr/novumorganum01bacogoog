We will lay this down, th'erefore, as the genuine and per-

fect rnle of practice, ‚thet it should be certain, free and pre-

p,aratogx or having relation to practice. And this is the

same thing as the ᾶὶεοονοιχ of a true form3 for the form of

ang nature is such² that when it is Qed the particular

when that nature is present, and universauy attests such

presence, and is inherent in the whole of it. , 'Phe same
form is of such a character, that if it be removed the par·

absence, and exists in no other nature. Lastly, the true
form is such, that it deduces the articular nature from some
source of essence existing in many “UbQ and more known
(as they term it) to nature, than the form itself. Such, then,
is our determination and rule with regard to a genuine and
perfect theoretica] axiom, that a nature be found convertible
with a given nature, and yet such as to limit the more
known nature, in the manner of a real genus. But these
two rules, the practica} and theoretical, are in fact the
