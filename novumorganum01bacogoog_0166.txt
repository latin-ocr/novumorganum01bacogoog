r‘eotion of induction3 4. Of varying the investigetion sc·
cording to the nature of tho subject3 5. ot the prerogative
netnres with respect to investigation, or of what should be
the first or last objecto of our reseerch3 6. ot the limite of
investigationi, or a synopsis of all natures thet exist in the
nnivers03 7. ot the applicetion to practieal purposes, or of
what relatos to man3 8. Of the preparatione for investiga·
tion3 9. And lastly‚ of the ascending and descending scale
oi axioms.⁸⁸

XXII. Among the prerogative instances we viu first
mention solitary instanees. Solitary instances' ere those
which exhibit the required nature in subjecte that have
nothing in common with any other subject then the nature
in question, or which do not exhibit the required nature in
subjecte resembling others in every respect except that
of the nature in question3 for these instances manifestly
remove prolixity, and accelerate and confirm exclusion, so
that a few oi them are of as much avnil as many.

For instance, let the inquiry be the nature of color.
Prisms, crystalline geme, which yield colors not only inter·
nally bnt on the wall, dews, etc„ are solitary instances3 for

thet such s clessiflcstion is much ot the seme nature ss it. having to tosch the
stt ot building‚ we were to describe tools with reterence to the amount siid pisce
oi the work which they must do, instesd ot pointing ont their construction nod
ns03 ss u we were to inform the pupi! that we must heve tools tor lifting s
stone up, tools tor moving it sidewise, tools tor leying it unsre, end tools sor
cementing it firmly. 'l'he means sre thus lost in the end, and we resp tho imits
oi unnothodicnl srrmgement in the confusion os cross division. In addition,
all the instsnoes sre lesvened with the error or contounding the lsws with the
csuses oi phenomens, end we ero urged to adopt the fundamental error ot
secking thei-ein the universal agents, or general censes oi phenomenn, without
escending the grndusl steps ot intermediste lawa-Ed.
