mon, should be referred to this division, for they bring that
which is not the object of the senses within their sphere.
They are therefore to be everywhere diligently songht after.

With regsrd to the fifth cause of objects escaping our
senses, itis clear that the action of the sense takes place by
motion, and 'this motion is time. If, therefore, the motion
of any body be either so slow or so swift as not to be pro·
portioned to the necessary momentum which operatos on the
nenses, the object is not perceived at all; as in the motion of
the bour hund, and that, again, of a inuelem-bell. 'I'he mo·
tion which is imperceptible by the senses from its slowness,
is readily and usually rendered sensible by the accumula·
tion of motion; that which is imperceptible from its veloc-
ity, hes not as yet been well measured; it is necessary, how·
ever, that this should be done' 1n some cases, with a view to
a proper investigation of nature.

The sixth case, where the sense is impeded by the power
of the object, admits of a reduction to the sensible sphere,
either by removing the object to a greater distance, or by

desdening its effects by the interposition of a medium, -

which may wesken end not destroy the object3 or by the
admission of its reflection where the dimct impression- is .too
strong, as that of the sun in s. basin of water.-
. 'Phe seventh cese, where the senses ere so overenargod
with the object as to leave no further room, scarcely occurs
except in the smell or teste, and is not of much consequence
ss regards our present subject. Let what we heve said,
therefore, suffice with regal-d to the reduction to the sensi-
ble sphere of objects not naturally within its compass.
Sometimes, however, this reduction is not extended to ·
the senses of man, but to those of some other animal, whose
ο senses, in some points, exoeed those of ωας as (with regard
