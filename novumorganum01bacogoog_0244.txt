take place in times the sums of which can be computed.
With regal-d to heat, we* see that boys in winter bathe
their hands in the flame without being burned; and con-
jurers, by quick and regular movements, overturn vessels
filled with wine or water, and replace them without spilling
the· liquid, with several similar instances. 'Phe compres-

sion, expansion and eruption oi several bodies, take place “

more or less rapidly, according to the nature of the body
and its motion, but still in definite momenta.

. In the explosion of several cannon at once (wh-ich are
sometimes heard at the distance oi thirty miles), the sound
of those nearest to the spot is heard before that of the most ,
distant. Even in sight (whose action is most rapid), it is
clear that a definite timo is necessary for its exertion,
which is proved by certain objects being invisible from
the velocity oi their motion, such as a musket·ball; for
the ssight of the ball is too swift to allow an impression
of its figure to be conveyed to the sight.

This last instance,·and others of a like nature, have
sometimes excited in us a most marvellous doubt, no less
than whether the image of the sky and stars is perceived
as at the actual moment oi its existence, or rather a little
after, and whether there is not (with regard to the visible
appearance of the heavenly bodies) a true and apparent
time, as well as a true and apparent place, which is ob·
served by astronomers in parallaxes. It appeared so in·
credible to us, that the images‘ or radiations of heavenly
bodies could suddenly be conveyed through such immense
spaces to the sight, and it seemed that they ought rather
to be transmitted in a definite time. '⁸ 'Phat doubt, however

⁸⁸ Bomer, a Dani-h asu-emmer, was the first to demonstrate, by connecting
the irregularities oi the eclipses ot Jupiter’s satellites with their d’ntances {rom
