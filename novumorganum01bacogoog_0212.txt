way-s before us vithsegard to this nature. 'l'his motion is
excited either by the mere effert oi the body expanding
itseli when inflamed‚ or by the assisting effert of the crude
spirit, which escapes rapidly from fite, and burste violently
from the surroundiug fleme as trem a prison. The school,
however, and common opinion only consider the first effort3
for men think that they are great philosophers when they
assei-t that fleme, from the form oi the element, is endowed
with a kind oi necessity oi occupying a greater space than
the same body had occupied when in the form of powder‚
and that thence proceeds the motion in question. In the
meantime they do not observa that although this may be
true, on the supposition of flame being geum-ned, yet the
generation may be impeded by a weight ot sufficient force
to compress and suffocate it, so that no such necessity existe
as they assert. 'I'hey are right, indeed, in. imagining that
the expansion and the consequent omission or removal of
the opposing body, is necessary if flame be once generated.
but such a necessity is avoided if the solid opposing mass
suppress the· flame before it be generated3 and we in fact
see that flame, especially at the moment of its gensi-atich,
is mild and gentle, and requires a hollow space where it
can play and try its force. 'I'he great violence of the effect,
thereforeJcannot be attributed to this cause; but the truth
is, that the generation of these exploding flames and fiery
blasts arisoe from the conflict oi two bodies oi a decidedly
opposite naturess—the one very inflammable, as is the sul·
phur, the other having an antipathy to flame, namely, the
crude spirit of the nitre; so that an extraordinary conflict
takes place while the sulphur is becoming inflamed as iar
as it can (for the third body, the willow charcoal, merely
incorporates and conv-eniently unites the two others), and
