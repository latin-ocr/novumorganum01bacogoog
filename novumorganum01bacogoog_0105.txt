CXXIII. We my, therefore, apply ιο ourselves the
joke of him who said, that water and wine drinkers oould
not think alike,“ especially ee it hits the matter so well.
For others, both ancients und moderna, have in the soienoes
dmnk a erade liquor like water, either flowing οἱ intell
from the undet-standing, or drawn up by logie es the wheel

a liquor made of many well-ripened grupen, oolleoted and
pluoked from particular buoches, squeezed ‚in the pte-s, ’
and at last olarified and fermented in a vessel. It is not,
therefore, wondertnl that we should not agree with others.

quiet and tranquillity of abstrnet visdom. We villingly
assent to their reasoning‚ and are most anxious to effect the

very point they hint at end require. For we are founding ἢ
