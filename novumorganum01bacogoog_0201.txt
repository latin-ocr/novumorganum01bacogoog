nature should be assigned, on account of the frequent and,

88881 concurrence oi several naturee, the inntenoee oi the· '

eroes show that the 88188 of one nature-with the required ·
nature 18 firm and indissoluble, while that oi the other 18
uneteady and separab103 by which 818888 the question 18
decided, and the first 18 received 88 the 88888, while the
other 18 dismissed and rejected. Such instancee, therefore,
afford great light, and are oi great weight, 88 that the course
oi interpretation sometimes terminatee, and 18 completed in-
them. Sometimes, however, they are found among the
instancee already obeerved, but they are generally new,-

being expreeely and purposely eought for and applied, end
brought to light only by attentive and active diligence.

For example: let the required nature be the flow and
ebb of the 888, which 18 repeated twice 8 day, at intervals
of aix honre between each advance and retreat, with some
little difference, agreeing with the motion of the moon. We
have here the following croeewaye:

. This motion must be occasioned either by the advancing
and the retiring 'of the 888, like water shaken in 8 118818,
which leaves one side while it wachee the othei-3 or by the rie·
ing oi the 888 from the bottom, and ite again subciding, like
boiling water. But 8 doubt erices, to which of ‘thece 888888
we >should aesign the flow and ebb. lf the firet asoertion be
admitted, it follows, that when there 18 8 flood on one eide,

“ there must at the same time be an ebb on another, and the ’

question therefore 18 reduced to thie. Now Acoeta, and
some othere, aiter 8 diligent inquii-y„ have obeerved that
the flood tide takes place on the coast os Florida, and the
opposite coacte oi Spain and Africa, at the came time, 88
does 8188 the ebb3 end that there 18 not, on the contrary, 8

flood tide at Florida when there 18 88 8111) 88 the coasts oi .
