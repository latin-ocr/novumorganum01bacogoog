denly, but only to change by degi-ees, and of their own
accord. .It is, however, much more necessary to intimate
to mankind (because many other points depend upon this),
thet the violent motion which we call mechanicel, and
Democritus (who, in explaining his primm-y motione, is
to be ranked even below the middling class of philoso-
phers) termed the motion of a blow, is nothing ,else than
this motion of 'liberty, namely, a tendency to relaxation
from compi-cesion. For in all simple impulsion or flight
through the air, the body is not displaced or moved in
space, until its parts are placed in an unnatural state, and

compressed by the impelling force. When that takes ’

place, the different parts urging the other in succes·

sion, the whole is moved, and that with a rotator-y es ”

well as progressive motion, in order that the parts may,
by this means also, set themselves at liberty, or more
readily submit. Let. this suffice for the motion in
question. .

liberty, bodies abhor, reJ‘ect, and avoid a new size or vol·

power, to rebound and resume their former density3 on the
contrary, in the motion of matter, they are anxious to ac·
quire a new volume or dimension, and attempt it willingly
and rapidly, and occasionally by a most vigorous effort‚ es

least most frequent, though not the only instrumente of
this motion, are heat and cold. For instance, the air, if
expanded by tension (as by suction in the glass egg), strug-
