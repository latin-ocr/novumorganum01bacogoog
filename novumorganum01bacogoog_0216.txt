XXXV 11. We will treat oi the instance· of divorce as
the fltteenth oi our prerogative instances. 'l'hey indicate
the separation oi natures of the most common occurrence.
'I'hey differ, however, from those snbjoined to the accom-
panying instances; for the instances of divor-ce point ‘out
the separation of a particular nature from some concrete
substance -with which it is usually found in conjunction,
while the hostile instances point out the total separation of
one nature from another. 'l'hey differ, also, from the in-
stances of the crosa, because they decide nothing, but only
inform us that the one nature is capable ot being separated
from the other. They are of use in exposing false forms,
and dissipating hasty theories derived from obvious facts:
⁴so that they add ballast and weight, as it were, to the
understanding. ⁸

For instance, let the aequit-ed natures be those four
which Telesina terms associatos, and of the same family,

’- namely, heat, light, rarity, and mobility, or promptitude

to motion3 yet many instances oi di vorce can be discovered
between them. Air is rare and easily moved, but neither
hot nor light3 the moon is light but not hot3 boiling water
is warrn bnt not light3 the motion of the needle in the com·
pass is swist and active, and yet its substance is cold, dense,
and opaqu03 and there are many similar examples.

Again, let the required natures be corporeal nature and
natural action, The latter appears incapable of subsisting
without some body, yet may we, perhaps, even here find an
instance of divorce, as in the magnetie motion, which draws
the iron to the magnet, and heavy bodies to the globe of the '
earth; to which we may add other actions which operate at
α a distance. For such action takes place in time, by distinct
moments, not in an instant3 and in space, by regular de-
