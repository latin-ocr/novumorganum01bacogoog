not be passed over, not relating ιο progressive bnt epherieal
motion—that ie, the expansion ofaebodies into a greater, or
their contractiori into a leesor ephere. For in our measure
of this‘motion we must inquire what degree of eompreeeion
or extension bodies easily and readily admit of, aeeord·
ing ιο their nature, and at what point they begin ιο reeiet
it, eo as et last ιο beer it no further—aa when en inflated
bladder ie eompreeeed, it allows a certain eompreeeion of
the air, but if thie be inereaeed‚ the 'air does not suffer
it, and the bladder is buret. ·

We heve proved this by a more delicate experimen&
we took a metnl bell, of a ligh't and thiu sort, anob ae ie
need for salt-cellere, end immereed it in a basin of water?

eo· ee ιο carry the air contained in its interior down with ἰι ·

ιο the bottom of the basin. We hed first, however, placed
· a small globo at the bottom of the basin, over whieh we
plaeed the bell. {rho result wne, that is the globe were
small compared with the interior oi >the—bell, the air would
eontraet ἰιεοῙί, and be eompreeeed without being foreed out,
bnt if it were ιοο large for the nir reedily ιο yield ιο it,
the latter became impatient oi the pressure, raised th'e bell
partly up, and eet-‚ended in bubblee. ·

“ 'Po prove, aleo, the extension (ae well ae the eompree·
sion) whieh air admits of, we adopted the following method:
-We took a glane egg, with a small hole at one end; we
drew ont the air by violent suetion at this bole, and then
eloeed-the hole with the finger, itnmereed the egg in water,
and then removed the finger. The air being eonetmined by
the effort made in motion, and dilated beyond im natural
etate, an‘d therefore etriving ιο meover and eontraet iteelf
(eo that if the egg had not been immersed in water, it would
have drawn in the air with a hiseing sound), now drew in
