call twilight instances3 they are as it were opposed to the
conspicuous instances, ior they show the required nature in

rudimenta, making an effert anda sort oi first attempt, but
concealed and subdued by a contrary nature. Such in·
stances are, however, of great importance in discovering
forms, for as' the conspicuous tend easily to differences, so
do the clandestine best lead to genera, that is, to those com·

fluids, as a water bubble, which is a sort of consistent and
bounded pellicle formed out os the substance of the water.
So eaves’ droppings, if there be enough water to follow
them, draw themselves out into a thiu thread, not to break
the continuity oi the water, but if there be not enough to
follow, the water forms itself into a round drop, which is the
best form to prevent a breach of continuity; and at the mo-
ment the thread cesses, and the water begins to fall in drops‚
the thread of water recoils upward to avoid such a breach.
Nay, in metals, which when melted are liquid but more
tenacious‚ the melted drops often recoil and are suspended.
There is something similar in the instance of the child's look·
ing-glass, which little boys will sometimes form of spittle
between rushes, and where the same pellicle of water is ob·
servable; and still more in that other amusement of children,
when they take some water rendered a little more tenacious
by soap, and inflate it with a pipe, forming the water into a
sort oi castle oi bubbles, which assumes such consistency,
