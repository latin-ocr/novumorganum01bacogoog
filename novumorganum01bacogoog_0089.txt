GV. In forming axioma² we must invent a different form ln d υ.- 71,
of induction from that hitherto in neci not only for the
proci and discovery of principles (aa they are celled), but
also of minor, intel-mediate, and, in short, every kind of
axioma. The induction which Eroceeds bg eimRLe enumer-
ation is puerile² lende to uncertain conclusione, and is ex·
poeed to danger from one contradictory inst-‚neq deciding
generally from too small a number ol fecte, and those only ⁸

separate nature bg grongi· rejectione and exclusione² and

then conclude for the affirmative² aiter collecting a sufficient
number of negativos. Now thie hae not been done, nor even

of man must necessarily be employed, in order to exhibit n

'Phe assistance of induction is to serve ne not only in the dis·

described.
CVI. In forming our axioms from induction, we must ‘

examine and try whether the axiom we derive be onlx fitted
nnd calculated for the Earticnlar instancee from which it ie
