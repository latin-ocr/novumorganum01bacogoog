'I'he rays of the moon, stars, and comete, are not found
to be warm to the touch, nay, the severest cold has been
observed to take place at the- full of the moon. Yet the
larger fixed stars are supposed to increase and render more
intense the heat of the sun, as he approaches them, when
the sun is in the sign of the Lion, for instance, and in the
dog-days.·¹‘

'I'he rays of the sun in what is caUed the middle region
of the air give no heat, to account for which the commonly
assigned reason is satisfactory3 namely‚ that that region is
neither sufficiently near to the body of the sun whence the ’
rays emanata, nor to the earth whence they are reflected.
And the fact is manifested by snow being perpetual on the
tops of mountains, unless extremely lofty. But it is ob·
served, on the other hand, by some, that at the Peak of
Teneriffe, and also among the Andes of Peru, the tops of
the mountains are free from snow, which only lies in the
lower part as you ascend. Resides, the air on the summit
of these mountains is found to be by no means cold, but
only thin and sharp3 so much so, that in the Andes it prioks
and hurts the eyes from its extreme sharpness‚ and even ex·

as large in other quarters ot the zodiac, when it looks down upon the earth
through the murky clouds ot winter. When that luminary is in Leo, the heat
of the earth is certainly greater than at any other period, but this arises trem
