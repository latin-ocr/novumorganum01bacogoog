· simple conformatione, for it is nothing more than the sym·
meti-y between these forms and conformatione.

‘'I'he greater and more universal species of harmony are
not, however, so wholly obscure, and with them, therefore,
we must commence. 'Phe first and principal distinction be·
tween them is this3 that some bodies differ considerably in
the abundance and rarity of their substance, bnt coi-respond
in their conformation3 others, on the contrary, correspond in
the former and differ in the latter. Thus the chemists have
well observed, that in their trial oi first principles sulphur
and mei-cury, as it were, pervade the univers03 their reason·
ing about salt, however, is absurd, and merely introduced
to comprise earthy dry fixed bodies. ln the other two,
indeed, one of the most universal species of natural har·
mony manifesta itself. Thus there is¹ a correspondenee be·
tween sulphur, cil, greasy exhalations, fleme, and, perhaps,

’ the substance of the stars, On the 'other hand, there is a

like correspondence between meroury‚ water, aqueous vapor,
air, and, perhaps, pure inter-sidereal ether. Yet do these
two quaternione, 'or great natural tribes (each within its own
limite), differ immensely in quantity and density os sub· ·
stance, while they generally agree in conformation, as is
manifest in many instances. On the other hand, the metals
agree in such quantity and density (especially when eom·
pared with vegetables, etc.), but differ in many respecta in
conformation. Animals and vegetables, in like manner,

γει-γ in their almost infinite modes of conformation, but ,

range within very limited degi-ees of quantity and density
of substance.

The next most general correspondence is that between
individua} bodies and those which supply them by way of
menstruum or support. Inquiry, therefore, must be made
