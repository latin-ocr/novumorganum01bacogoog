the spirit of nitre is escaping, as iar also as it can, and at
the same time expanding itself (for air, and all crude sub·
stances, and water are expanded by heat), fanning thus,
in every direction, the flame οί the sulphur by its escape
and violence, just as if by invisible bellows.

Two kinds oi instances of the cross might here be used
——the one of very inflammable substances, such as sulphur
and camphor, naphtha and the like, and their compounds,
which take fire more readily and easily than gunpowder it
left to themselves (and this shows that the effert to catch
fire does not of itself produce such a prodigious effect); the
other ot substances which avoid and repel flame, such as all
salts3 ior we see that when they are cast into the fite, the
aqueous spirit escapes with a creckling noise before flame
is produced, which also happens in a less degree in stiff
let-ves, from the escape oi the aquecus part wetere the oily
part has caught fire. This is more particularly observed in
quicksilver, which is not improperly called mineral water,
and which, without any inflammation, nearly equale the
force of gunpowder by simple explosion and expansion,
and is said, when mixed with gunpowder, to increase its
force.

‚Agaim let the required nature be the transitcry nature
of flame and its momentaneous extinction3 for ιο us the
nature of flame does not appear ιο be fixed or settled, but
to be generated from moment ιο moment, and to be every
instant extinguished3 it being clear that those flames which
continue and last, do not owe their continuance to the same
mass of fiame, but to a continued succession of new flame
regularly generated, and that the same identical flame does
not continue. This is easily shown by removing the foed
or source os the fleme, when it at oncegoes out. We
