twofold, either by approximation or by analogy. For in·
stance, there is no known medium which entirely prevents
the effect of the magnet in attracting iton—neither gold,
nor silver, nor stone, nor glus, wood, water, oil, ‘cloth,
or fibrous bodies, air, fleme, or the like. Yet by accurate
experiment, a medium may perhaps be found which would
deaden its effect, more than another comparatively and in
degi-003 as, for instance, the magnet would not perhaps
attract iron through the same thickness of gold as oi air,
or the same quantity of ignited as of cold silver, and so on;
ior we have not ourselves made the experiment, but it will
'suffice as an example. Again, there is no known body
” which is not susceptible of heat, when brought near ,the
fire; yet air becomes warm much sooner than stone. These
are examples of substitution by approximation.
substitution by analogy¹ is useiul, but less sure, and
therefore to be adopted with some judgment. It serves to
reduce that which is not the object of the senses to. their
sphere, not by the perceptible operatione of the impercep-
tible body, but by the consideration of some similar pcr-

. ceptible body. For instance, let the subiect tor inquil-y be

'the mixtum of spirits, which are invisible bodies. There

appears to be some relation between bodies and their sources . · - ’

or support. Now, the source of flame seems to be oil and
-fat3 that of air, water, and watery substances3 for flame
increases over the exhalation of oil, and air over that of
water. One must therefore consider the mixture of oil and
water, which is manifest to the senses, since that ,oi air and
,fleme in general escapes the senses. But oil and water mix
very imperfectly by composition or stirring, while they are
exactly and nicely mixed in herbe, blood, and the parts of
animala] Something similar, therefore, may ‚take place in
