ιο the quantity, that if a leaden bullet of one ounce, for
instance, would fall in a given time, one of two ounces
ought to fall twice as rapidly, which is most erroneous.
‘Nor does the same ratio prevail in every kind ot power,
their difference being considerable. The‘ measure, there·
fore, must be determined by experiment, and not by proba·
bility or conjecture. ⁵

Lastly, we must in all our investigatione oi nature ob·
serve what quantity, or dose, of the body is requisito for a
given effect, and must at the same time be gual-ded against
estimating it at too much or too little.

XLVm.1n the twenty· ·fourth rank of prerogative in·
stances we will place wrestling instances, which we are also
wont to call instances of predominance. They are such as
point ont the predominance and submission of powers com·
pared with each other, and which ,of them is the more ener-
getic and superior, or more weak and inferior. For the
motions and effecte of bodies are compounded, decom·
posed, and combined„ no less than the bodies themselves,
We will exhibit, therefore, the principal kinds ot motione
or active powers, in order that their comparative strength,

> and thence a demonstration and definition of the instances

in question, may be rendered more clear.

Let the first motion be that of the resistance of matter,
which exists in every particle, and completely prevents its
annihilation3 so that no conflagration‚ weight, pressure, vio·
leuce, or length of time can reduce even the smallest por·
tion of matter ιο nothing, or prevent it from being some·
thing, and occupying some space, and' delivering itself
(whatever straits it be put to), by changing its form or
place, or, ii that be impossible, remaining as it is; nor can
it ever happen that it should either be nothing or nowhere.
