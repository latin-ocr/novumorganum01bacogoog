V. But the rnlc or sxiom for thc musici-motion oi bodies

is of two kinds. 'Pho first rggsrds thc bodx as tn &Qu
or combination of simglo natum. Thus, in gold cre united

the following circumstances: it is yollow‚ hecvy, oi a ccr-
tain weight, mallcablc and ductile to a certain cxtcnt3 it is
not volatile, loscs part ot its substance by firo, mclts in a
particular manner, is separated and dissolvcd by particular
mcthods, and so of the other natm-cs observable in gold.
An uictu, therefore, of this kind deduces thc subject from
the forms οὶ simple ηκτοι-θος for hc who has acquircd the
forms and methods of superinducing yellowness, wcight,
ductility‚ stability, deliquesccncc‚ solution, and the like,
and their degi-ecs and modes, will consider and conti-ive how
to unite them in any body, so as to transform⁸ it into gold.
And this mcthod of operating belongs to primary action3 for
it is the same thing to produce cnc οι· many simple natm-cs,

tiens, if many bc required, on account of the difficulty of
uniting many naturas together. It must, however, bc ob·

tures as simple though in a concrete body) sets ont from
what is constant, ctcrncl, and universal in nature, and opens
such broad paths to human power, as the thoughts os inan
