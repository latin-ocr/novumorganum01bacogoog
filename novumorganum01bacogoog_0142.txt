Table ⁰f the Demea or Comparative Imtanees of Heat

We will first spenk of those bodies which exhibit no
degree of hest sensible to the toueh, but appear rather to
possess e, potential heat, or disposition and preparation {or
it. We will then go on to others, which are actually warm
to the touoh, and observe the strength and degree of it.

1. 'Phere is no known solid or tangible body whioh is by
its own nature originally warm3 for neither stone, metal,
sulphur, fossile, wood‚ water, nor dead enimal enroasses are
found warni. 'I'he warm springs in baths appear to be
heated accidentally, by fleme, subterraneous fire (suoh as
is throren up by Etna and many' other mountains), or by the
eontaet of eertain bodies, as ,heat is exhibited in the dissolu·
tion of·⁴ iron and tin. 'Phe degree of heat, therefore, in·
inanimato obieote is not sensible to our touch3 but they
differ in their degrees of eold‚ for wood and metal are not
equally oold.¹⁴ This, however, belongs to the 'I'ane of
Degrees of Gold.

2. But with regard to potential hest and predisposition
to fleme, we find many inanimato snbstanoes wonderfully
adapted to it, as sulphur, naphtha, and saltpetre.

3. Bodies which have previously aequired heat, as horse
dung from the animal, or lime, and perhaps ashes and soot ”
from fire, retain some latent portion of it. Hence distilla-
tions and separatione of substanees are effeeted by burying

³⁴ Baoon here mistnkes senention oonflned to ourselves for en internsl prop-
erty ot distinet substnnoes. Meuia ere denser than vood. and our= bodies eon·
sequently coming into eontnet with more particles ot matter when we touch
them, lose e greater quantity ot hest than in the ense ot lighter sub-

stances. -Εά,
