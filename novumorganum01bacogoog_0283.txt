to unite, and restrain their violent and pertin-bed motion.

’ Ecce-water, for instance, applied to the nostrils in sainting

fits, causes the resolved and relaxed spirits to recover them·
selves, and, as it were, cherishes them. But o'piates‚ and
'the like, banish the spirits by their malignant and hostile
quality. Ii they be applied, therefore, externally, the
spirits immediately quit the part and no longer readily
flow into it: but if the} be taken internally, their vapor,
'mounting to the head, expels, in all directione, the spirits
contained in the ventricles os the brain, and since these
spirits retreat, but cannot escape, they consequently meet
and are condensed, and are sometimes completely extin-
guished and suffocated3 although the same opiates, when
taken in moderation, by a secondary accident (the conden-
sation which succeeds their anion), strengthen the spirits, -‘
render them more nobnst, and check their useless and in·
flammatory motion, by which means they contributa not-a

little to the cure oi diseases, and the prolongation oi life.
· 'Phe preparations of bodies, also, ior the reception of cold
should not be omitted, such as that water a little warmed is ⁸

more easily irozen than that which is quite cold, and the ’

like.

Mol-cover, since nature supplies cold so sparingly, we
must act like · the apothecarios, who, when they cannot
obtain any simple ingl-edient, take a succedaneum, or quid
pro quo, as they term it, such as aloes ior xylobalsamum,
cassia ior cinnamon. ln the same manner we should look
diligently about na, toascertain whether there may be any
substitutes ior cold, that is -to say, in what other manner
condensation can be effected, which is the peculial· opera-
tion oi cold. Such condensations appear hitherto to be. oi

four kinds only. 1. By simple compression, which is oi lit· ·
