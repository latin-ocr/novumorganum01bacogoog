pinnacle of human inclusa-y, so as not to become tunm„ .

with them, but rather to suppose that nothing of the kind
can be accomplished, unless the same means be employed,
, with perhaps a little more diligence, and more accurate
preparation.

Now, on the contrary, it may be stated aa a fact, that
the ways and means hitherto discovered and observed, of
effecting any matter or work, are ior the most part of little
velue, and that all really efficient power depende, and is
really to be deduced from the sources of forms, none
of which have yet been discovered.

Thus (as we have before observed), had any one medi·
tated on ballistic machinos, and battering rems, as they were
used by the ancients, whatever application he might have
exerted, and though. he might have oonsumed a whole life
in the puriuit, yet would he never have hit upon the in·
vention oi flaming engines‚ acting by means oi gnnpowder3
nor would any person, who had made woollen manusacto·
ries and cotton the subject oi his observation and reflection,

have ever discovered thereby the nature of the silkworm ’

or of silk.

Hence all the most noble discover-ies have (if you oh·
serve) come to light, not by any gradual improvement and-
extension oi the arta, but merely by chanee; while nothing
imitatos or anticipatos chance (which iswont to act at in-
tervals of ages) but the invention of forms.

There is no necessity for adducing any particular exam·
ples of these instances‚ since they are abundant. 'I'he plan
to be pnrsued is this: all the mechanical, and even the lib·
eral arts (as faras asthey are practical), should be visited and
thoroughly examined‚ and thence there should be formed
a compilation or particular history of the great master·
