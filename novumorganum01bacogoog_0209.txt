quenched in a direction parallel to the north and south,
also acquires polaritjr without the touch of the unguet, as
is the parts of iron being· put in motion by ignition, and
afterward recovering themselves, were, at the moment of
being quenched, more susceptible and sensitive of the power

emanating from the earth, than at other times, and therefore ν

as it were egcited. But these points, though well obscrved,
do not completely prove his assertion.

An instance of the cross on thie point might,be as fol·
lows: Let a small magnetic globe be taken, and its poles
marked, and placed toward the east and west, not toward
the north and south, and let it continue thus. 'l'hen let an
untouched noedle be placed over it, and suffered to romain*
so ior six or seven days. NoW, the needle (for this is not
disputed), while it remains over the magnet, will leave the
poles of the world and turn to those of the magnet, and
therefore, as long ss it remeius in the above position, viu
turn to the east and west. But if the needle, when removed
from the magnet and placed upon a pivot, be found imme·-
diately to turn to the north and south, or even by degrees
to return thither, then the presence oi the earth must be
considered as the cause, but if. it remains turned ss at first,
toward the east and west, or lose its polarity, then that cause
must be suspected, and further inquiry made.

Again, let 'the required nature be the corporea] substance
of the moon, whether it be rare, flery, and aerial (ss most
of the ancient philosopher-s have thought), or solid and
dense (as Gilbert and many of the moderns, with some of
the ancieutS, hold).·· 'Phe reasons sor this latter opinion
