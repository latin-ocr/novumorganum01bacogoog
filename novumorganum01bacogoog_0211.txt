Agsim let the required natm-e be the motion oi projee-
tiles (sueh ss dsrts, strowe, and balle) through the sir. The
school,.in its usual manner, treats this very carelessly, eon·
sidet-ing it enough to distinguish it by the name oi violent
motion, from that whioh they term natural, and ss iar ss
regards the first percussion or impulse, sstisfies itself by its
satiem, that two bodies esnnot exist in one pluoe, or there
would be s penetration oi dimensione. With regsrd to this
nature we have these two orosswsys—'I'he motion must
srise either from the sir carrying the projeotecl body, and
eolleeting behind it, like s stream behind bosts, or the wind
behind straws3 or from the parts oi the body itseli not sup·

as is olesr from s vast 'number oi experiments. Among
others we may take this instsnee of the eroes, untimely, that·

the body, because the source oi motion is'in the eentre oi
