firmity of a deficient sight, and therefore give no further
information) in the lately invented microscopes, which ex·
bibit the latent and invisible minutia of substanoes, and
their hidden formation and motion, by wonderfully in·
creasing their apparent magnitude. By their assistance we
behold with astonishment the accurate form and outline

oi a flea, mose, and animalcula, as well as their previously

invisible color and motion. It is said„also, that an ap· ’

parently straight line, drawn with a pen or pencil, is dis·
covered by such a microscope to be very uneven and 'curved,
because neither the motion of the hand, when assisted by
a ruler, nor the impression of ink or color, are really regu-
lar, although the irregularities are so minute as not ‚to be
perceptible without the assistance of the microscope. Men

have (as is usual in new and wonderful discover-ies) added ἰ

a superstitious remark, that the microscope sheds a lustre
on the works ot nature, and dishonor on those of art, which
only means that the tissue of nature 'is much more delicate “
than that of art. For the microscope is only of use for
minute obiecta, and Democritus, perhaps, ii he had seen
it, would have exulted in the thought oi a means being·
discovered for seeing his atom, which he affirmed to be
entirely invisible. But the inadequacy oi these micro·
scopes, sor the observation of any but the most minute
bodies, and even of those if parts of a larger body, destroys

’ their utilit53 for if the invention could be extended to
“ greater bodies, or the minute parts of greater bodies, so

that a piece of cloth would appear like a net, and the
latent minutim and irregularities oi gems, liquide, urine,
blood, wounds, and many other ‘things could be rendered
visible, the greatest advantage would, without doubt, be
derived.
