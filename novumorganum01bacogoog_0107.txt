scruple; for we allow thet the ancient· hed e particular
form of investigation and discovery, end their writings show
it. But it was of such a nature, that they immediatelg flev

from a few instances and particulare §efter adding some
common notione, und a few genet-elix received opinions

ciples of the sciences‚ und then by their intermediite propp-

both far from being what they ought to have been, und
their flying off to generalities ruined everything. ,
CXXVI. Another objection viu be made against us,
that we prohibit decisione and the luying down of certain
principles, till we eri-ive regularly at generalities by the ·
intel-mediate steps, and thus keep the judgment in suspense

and lead to uncertainty. But our object is not uncertainty

know nothing which we ought.
CXXVII. Amin, some may mise this question rather

than objection‚ whether we tnlk oi periecting natural phi·
