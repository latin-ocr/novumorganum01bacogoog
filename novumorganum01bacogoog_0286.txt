tity3 to which should be added the acceleration in p'oint of
time. Bust, for instance, is the result oi a long process,
'but crocus martis is obtained immediately; and the same
may be observed ot natural verdigris and ceruse. Crystal
is formed slcwly, while glass is blcwn immediately: stones
increase slcwly, while bricks are baked immediately, etc.
In the meantime (with regard to our present subject) every
different species of heat should, with its peculiar effecte, be
‚ diligently collected and inquired into3 that oi the heavenly
bodies, whether their rays be direct, reflected, orsefraoted,
or condensed by a burning·glass; =that ot lightning, fiame,
and ignited charcoa13 that of fire of different materiale,

bellove, or quiescent, removed to a greater οι· less distance,

the balmum Marios, and the dunghi113 the external and in·

We should, however, particularly attend to the investi·
gation and discovery of the effects and operatione ot beat,
when made to approach and retire by degreee, regularly,
periodically, and by proper intervals of space and time.
For this systematical inequality is in truth the daughter of
heaven and mother of generation, nor can any great result
be expected from a vehemeut, precipitato, or desultory heat.
For this is not only most evident in vegetables, but in the “
wombs oi animale also there arises a great inequality os
beat, from the motion, sleep, food, and passione of the
female. 'Phe same inequality-prevails in those subterranc-
