LXIV. The empiric school produces dess ot a more ν
deformed and monstrons nature than the sophistic or theo·

·rctic school; not bein-ig founded in the light oi Q 22,-

cies of philosophy appears probahle, and almost certain to

those who are daily practiced in such experimenta, and have

thus corrupted their imagination, but incredible and futile

We could not, however, neglect ιο cantion others against

this school, because we already foresee and augur, that if

men be hereafter induced by our exhortatione to apply seri-

onsly to experiments <binding sarowell ιο the sophi-tic doc· · s«

owing to the prematnre and forssrard haste of the under·
standing, and its jumping or flying to generalities and the
principles of things. We ought, therefore, already to meet
