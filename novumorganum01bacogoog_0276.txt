will place the generally useiul instances. 'l'hey sre such
ss relate to various points, and frequently occur, spat-ing
by that means considerable labor and new trials. · ‘l'he
proper place for treating of instrumente and contrivances,
will be that in which we speak of the application to practice,
and the methods of experiment. All that has hitherto been
ascertsined‚ and made use οἱ, will be described in the par·
ticular history of each art. At present, we will subjoin a
few general examples oi the instances in question.

Man acts, then, upon natural bodies (besides merely
bringing them-together or removiug them) by seven prin·
cipsl methodsz 1, by the exclusion οἱ all that impedes and
disturbs; 2, by compression, extension‚ agitation, and the
like3 3, by hest and cold; 4, by detention in a suitable
place; 5, by'checking or directing motion3 6, by peculiar
harmonies3 7, by a sessonable and proper alternation, series,
and succession of all these, or, at least, of some of them. .

. 1. With regard to the first—common air, which is al·
ways at hand, and forces its admission, as also the rays of
the heavenly bodies, create much disturbance. whatever,
therefore, tends to exclude them may well be considered as
generally useful. 'Phe substance and thickness of vessels
in which bodies ure placed when prepared for operations
may be referred to this head. So also may the accurate
methods of closing vessels by consolidation‚ or the lutum
sapientias, as the chemists call it. 'Phe exclusion of air by ’
nieaus of· liquids at the extremity is also very useiul, as
when they pour oil on wine, or the juices of herbs, which
by spreading itsels upon the top like a cover, preserves
them uninjured from the air. Powders, also, are service-
able‚ for although they contain air mixed up in them, yet
they -ward off the power oi the mass oi circumambient air,
