gles anxiously to restore itali, but. if heat be applied, it
strivee, on the contrary, to dilate itself, and longa for a
larger volume, regularly passing and migrating into it, as
into a new form (as it is termed); nor after a certain degree
oi expansion is it anxious to return, unless it be invited to
do so by the application oi cold, which is not indeed a re·-
turn, but a fresh change. So also water, when confined by
compression, resista, and wishes to become ae it ‘was before,
namely, more expanded3 but if there happen an intense
and continued cold, it changes itself readily, and of its own
aocord,‘ into the condensed state oi ice; and if the cold be
long continued, without any intervening warmth (as in
grottoes and deep caves), it is changed into crystal or simi·
lar matter, and never resumes its form.

Let the fifth be that which we term the motion of con· .

tinuity. We do not understand by this simple and primary
continuity with any other body (for that is the motion of
connection), but the continuity of a particular body in
itself; for it is most· certain that all bodies abhor a solu·
tion of continuity, some more and some less, but all par·
tially. In hard bodies (such ae steel and glass) the resist-
ance to an interruption ot continuity is most powertul and
efficacious, while although in liquida it appears to be faint
and languid‚ yet it is not altogether null, but exista in the
lowest degree, and shows itself in many experimenta, such
as bubbles, the round form of drops, the thin threads which
drip from rooss, the cohesion of glutinous substances, and
the like. It -is most conspicuous, however, if an attempt
be made to push this separation to still smaller particles. ·
Thus, in mortars, the pestle produces no effect after a cer·
tain degree of contusion, water does not penetrate small
fissures, and the air itself, notwithstanding its subtilty,
