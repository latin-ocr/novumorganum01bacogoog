No negative is here tubicined, except the remark that
spu-kt are not kindled by fiint and steel, or any other hard
substance, unless some small particles of the stone or metul
⁸ are struck ofl, and thet the sirmever forms them by friction,
as is commonly supposed3 besides, the spui-ks from, the
veight of the ignited substance have a tendency ιο descend
rather than ιο rise, und when extinguished become a sort
of dark seh. .

’ We are of opinion that here again there is no negative3
for we are not acquainted with any tangible body which does
not become decidedly verm by friction, so that the ancients
seigned that the gods had no other means or power of creat·
ing hest than the triction of nir, by rapid and violent rota-
tion. On this point, however, further inquiry must be
made, whether bodies proiected by machines (as balle irom
c3nnon) do not derivo some degree of heat from meeting the
air, which rendere them somewhnt wsrm when they fall.
'I'he air in motion rather cools than heats, ss in the winds,
the bellom, or breath when the mouth is contracted. 'I'he
motion, however, in such instances is not sufficiently rapid

- its component parts, so that it is not surprising that heat
should. not be generated.

We must make a more diligent inquiry into this in·
stance; for herbe und green and meist vegetsbles appear
ιο possess a latent heat, so small, however, es not to be
perceived by the touch in single specimens, but when they
are united and confined, so that their spirit cannot exhalo
into the air, and they rather wsrm each other, their heat
is at once manifestem and even fiame occasionally in suit·
