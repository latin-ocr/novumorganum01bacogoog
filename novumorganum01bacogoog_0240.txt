oi violent motione, such' as missiles, projectiles, wheels and
the like, since they are also manifestly confined to certain
limits. .

Some motions and virtues are ιο be found of a directly
contrary nature to these, which act in contect but not at a
distance; namely, such¹ as operate at a distance and not in .
contaot, and again act with less force at a less distance, and
the reverse. Sight, ior instance, is not easily effective in
contact, but requires a medium and ‚distance;. although 1
remember 'having 'heard from a person deserving of credit,
that in being cured of=a cataract (which was done by put·
ting a small silver needle within the first coat of the eye, to
remove the thin pellicle of the cataract, and force it into a
corner of the eye), he had distinctly seen the needle moving
across the'pupil. Still, though this may be true, it is clear

 

that large bodies cannot be seen well or distinctly, unless at ἱ '

the vertex of a cone, where the rays from the object meet
at some distance stom the eye. In old persons the eye sees
better it the object be moved a little further, and not nearer.
Again, it is certain that in proiectiles the impactis not so
