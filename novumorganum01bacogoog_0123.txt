pared with the real anatomy os latent conformation in bodies
which are considered similar, particularly in specific objects
and their parts3 as those of iron, stone, and the similar parts
of plante and animale, as the root, the lesi, the flower, the
flesh, the blood, and bones, etc. Yet human industry has
not completely neglected this species oi anatomy; for we
have an instance οἱ it in the separation of similar bodies by
distillatiom and other solutions, which shows the dissimi-
larity of the compound by the union oi the homogeneous
parts. These methods are nseful, and of importance to our
inquiry‚ although attended generally with fallacy: for many
natures are assigned and attributed to the separate bodies,
as if they had previously existed in the compotum, which,
in reality, are receutly bestowed and superinduced by fire
and heat, and the other modes of separation. Besides, it is,

“ atter au, but a amau part of tho labor of discovering the real

conici-matina in the compotum, which is so subtile and nice,

, that it is rather confused and lost by the operation oi the

natures and their forms which meet² and are combined in

Minerva, it we wish to bring to light the real texture and
conformation of bodies, upon which every occult and (as it
is sometimes called) specific property and virtue of things
depende, and whence also every rule οἱ poverful change and
