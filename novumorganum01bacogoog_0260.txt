When the epil-it or moinum, whioh hu mpornted into
spirit, hu mpod stom n potone body (such ‘ne wood‚
bone, parchment, end tho like), the thioker parts ire drawn
together, end united with n greater effert, nnd indm-stio-
or doeiooetion is the consequence3 nnd this we attribute not
no muoh to the motion of connection (in order to prevent a
vacuum), nn to thi· motion of friendnhip end union.
’ Union immadimooismqandyetin to he metvith
in more instance· then nro generally obaerved. We per·
eeive it when ono bubble dissolves another, when modi·
einen attrnet humore from n simihrity of eubetnnee, when
. one string moves another in unieon with it on different
instrumente, nnd the like. We are oi opinion thnt thi-
motion is very prevalent also in animal spirite, but nro
qulte ignorent os the root. It ie, however, conspicuous in
the magnet, and magnetized iron. While speaking of the
motione of the magunt, we must plainly distinguish them,
for there are four distinet powers or effecte of the magnet
which should not be eonfounded, although the wonder and
astonishment of mankind hae olnssed them together. 1. 'rho
attraction of the magnet to the unguet, or of iron to the
unguet, or of magnetized iron to iron. 2. Its polatity
toward the north and south, and its variation. 3. Its pene·
tration through gold, glum, stone, and all other eubstnneee.
4. The communication of power from the mineral to iton,
and from iron to iton, without any eommuniention of the
substaneee. Here, however, we only epeak of the first.
There is also a singular motion of attraction between quiek·
silver and gold, so that the gold attraets quieksilver even
when made uee of in ointment3 and those who work sur·
rounded by the vapors' of quieksilver‚ are wont to hold a
pieee of gold in their mouths, to collect the exhalatione,
