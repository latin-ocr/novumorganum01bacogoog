Spain and Africa. Yet if one consider the subject atten-
tively, this does not prove the necessity of *s rising motion,
nor refuto the notion of a progressive motion. For the
motion may be progressive, and yet inundate the opposite·
shores oi a channel at the same time3 es if the waters be
forced and driven together from some other quai-ter, for
instance, which takes place in rivers, lor they flow and ebb
town-d each bank at the same time, yet their motion is
clearly progressive, being that of the waters from the sea
‘catering their mouths. So it may happen, that the waters
coming in a vest body from the eastern Indian Ocean are
driven together, and forced into the channel of the Atlan-
tic, and therefore inundate both coasts at once. We must
inquire, therefore, it there be any other channel by which
the wetere can at the same time sink and ebb; and the
Southern Ocean at once suggests itself, which is not less
than the Atlantic, but rather broader and more extensive
then is requisito for this effect. ι

We at length arrive, then, at an instance of the eroes,
which is this. It it be positively discovered, that when the
flood sets in toward the opposite coasts of Florida and Spain
in the Atlantic, there is at the same time a flood tide on the
coasts ot Peru and the back part of China, in the Southern
Ocean, then assuredly, from this decisive instance, we must
reject the assei-tion, that the flood and ebb of the sea, about
which we inquire, takes place by progressive motion3 for
no other sea or place is leit where there can be an ebb. But
this may most easily be learned, by inquiring oi the inhab-
itants of Panama and Lima (where the two oceans are sepa·
rated by a narrow isthmus), whether the flood and ebb takes
place on the opposite sides ot the isthmus at the same time,
or the reverse. 'l'his decision or rejection appears certain,
