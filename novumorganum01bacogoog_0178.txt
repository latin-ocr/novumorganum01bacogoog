8. Π those who suffer from a eold blow their noses vio·
lently at the very moment in whieh they have anything
fotid or portumod in their mouth, or on their palate, they
instantly have a oleat perception of the fetor or pei-sume.
These instanees afford and constitute this speeies or division
‚of tante, namely, that it is in part nothing else than an in-
ternal smelling‚ passing and deseending through the upper
passages of the nostrils to the mouth and palate. But, on
the other hand, those whose· power oi smelling is deficient

rough, and bitter, and the like, as well as any one else: so
that the taste is clearly something oompounded of the in·
ternal smelling, and an exquisite speeies of toueh whioh

Again‚ as another example, let the required nature ·be
the communication of quality, without intel-mixture of sub-

speeies of communication, heat and the magnet another.
¹ For the communication of light is momentary and imme·
diately arrested upon the removal ol the original light.
But heat, and the magnetio force, when onee transmitted
to or exeited in another body, remain fixed for a consider·
able time after the removal of the source.

In fine, the prerogative of constitutive instanees is oon·
siderable, for they materially assist the definitione (especially
in detail) and the divisione or partitione ol natures‚ concern·
ing which Plato has well said, “He who ean properly define
and divide is to be considered a god.'' ⁴' ⁹

θ 'l'he collective lnstanees here 'meant are no other than general laets or
lun ot some degree ot genet-aliq, and are themselves the result ot induction.
