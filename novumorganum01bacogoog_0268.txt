be mistaken in supposing this to be really the case. For
ii it be asked, why the heavcns revolve from east to west,
rather than from west to east, or why they turn on poles
situate near the Bears, rather than round Orion or any
other part of the heaven, such a question appears to be
unreasonable, since these phenomena should be received aa
determinate and the objecta of our experience. There are,
indeed, some ultimate and seli-existing phenomcna in na-
ture, but those which we have just mentioned arc not to
be referred ιο that class: for we attribute them ιο a cer-
tain harmony and consent of the universe, which has not
yet been properly observed. But if the motion of the
earth from west to east be allowed4 the same question may
be put, lor it must also revolve round certain poles, and
why should they be placed where they are, rather thau
elsewhere? 'Phe polarity and variation of the needle come
under our present head. 'I'here is also observed in both
natural and artificial bodies, especially solide rather than
fluide, a particular collocation and position of parts, resem-
bling hairs or fibres, which should be diligently investi·
gade since, without a discovery of them, bodies cannot bo
conveniently controlled or wrought upon. 'l'he eddies ob·

Let the fifteenth motion be that of transmission or of
passage, by which the powers of bodies are more or less
impeded or advanced by the medium, according to the
nature of the bodies and their effective powers, and also
according to that of the medium. For one medium is
