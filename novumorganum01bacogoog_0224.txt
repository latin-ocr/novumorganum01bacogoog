agitated and retained in the latter3 the latter action is that
oi hest and the spirit, the former that oi the tangible pam
themselves, atter the spirit’s omission.

But when the spirit is neither entirely retained nor
omitted, but only strives and exercises itseli‚ within its
limite, and meets with tangible parts, which obey and
readily follow it wherever it leads them, then follows the
iormtion oi an organic body, and of limbs, and the other ·
· vital actions of vegetables and animale. These are rendered
sensibIe chiefly by diligent observation of the first begin·
nings, and rudiments or effecta ot lite in animalculae sprung ,
{rom putrefaction‚ as in the eggs of ants, worms, moeses,
frogs after rain, etc. Both a mild heat and a pliant sub·
stance, however, are necessary for the productiori of life,
in order that the spirit may neither hasti1y escape, nor be
restrained by the obstinacy of the parts, so as not to be able
to bend. and model them like wax.

Again, the difference of spirit which is important and
of effect in many points (as unconnected spirit, branching
spirit, branching and cellular spirit, the first oi which is
that of all inanimato substances‚ the second oi vegetables,
and the third of animale), is placed, as it were, before tho
eyes by many reducing instances. '

·Again, it is clear that the more-refined tissue and con·
formation of things (though forming the whole body of
visible or tangible objects) are neither visible nor tangibIe.
- Onr information, therefore‚·must here also be derived from‘
reduotfon to the sphere oi the senses. But the most radical
and primary difference of formation depends on the abun·
