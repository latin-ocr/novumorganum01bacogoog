have examplee oi their escape from tension, in the motion
of the air that remains in glane egge after suction, in stringe,
leuther, and eloth, which recoil after tension, unless it be

long continued. 'I'he schoole deflne thie by the term ot ·

motion from the form of the element3 inj udiciouely enough,
uince this motion ie to be found not only in air, water, or
fite, but in every species of solid, aa wood, iron, lead, cloth,
parchment, etc., each of which has its own proper sizc, and
ie with difficulty etretched to any other. Since, however,
thie motion of liberty ia the most obvious of all, and to be
seen in an infinite number of casce, it will be ae well to die·
tinguieh it correctly and clearly; for some most carelessly
coniound thie with the two others of resistance and connec-
tion3 namely, the ircedom from pressure with the former,
and that from tension with the latter, as ii bodies when com·
preeeed yiclded or expanded to prevent a penetration ot
dimensione, and when stretched rebounded and contracted
themselves to prevent a vacuum. But if the air, when
compreeeed, could be brought to the density of water, or
wood to that of stone, there would be no need oi any pene·
stration of dimensione, and yet the compression would be
much greater than they actually admit of. So if water
could be expanded till it became aa rare aa air, or stone as
rare as wood, there would be no need oi a vacuum, and yet
the expansion would be much greater than they actually
admit of.

We do not, therefore, arx-ive at a penetration of dimen-
sione or a vacuum before the extremes of condensation
and rarefaction, while the motion we epeak of stopa
and exerte itself much within them, and ia nothing more
than a desire oi bodies to preserve their specific density (or,
