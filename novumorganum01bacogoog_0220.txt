We have an instance of the second kind in the telescope,
discovered by the wonderful exertions of Galileo3 by the
auistance of which a nearer intercourse may be opened (as
by boats or vessels) between ourselvee and the heavenly
objects. For by its aid we are assured that the Milky Way
is but a knot or constellation of small stars, clearly defined
and separate, which the ancients only conjectured to be the
οπεος whence it appears to be capable of demonstration, that
the spaces of the planetary orbits (as they are termed) are
not quite destitute of other stare, but that the heaven begins
to glitter with stare before we arrive at the starry ephon,
although they may be too small to be visible without the
telescope. By the telescope‚ also, we can behold the revolu-
tione of smaller stars round Jupiter, whence it may be con·
jectured that there are several centres of motion among the
stare. By its assistance, also, the irregularity of light and
shade on the moon's surface is more clearly observod and
determined‚ so as to allow of asort of selenography..‘⁸ By
the telescope we see the spots in the sun, and other similar
phenomena3 all of which are most noble discoveries‚ as far
as credit can be safely given to demonstratione oi this
nature, which are on this account very suspicious‘, namely,
that experiment stops at these few² and nothing further has
yet been discovered by the same methodi, among objects
equally worthy of consideration.

We have instances of- the third kind in measuring-rods, ⁰
astrolabes‚ and the like, which do not enlarge‚ but correct
and guide the sight. If there be other instanees which assist

marks which they afforde'd him, computed its revolution to be performed in
twenty-ssve days and some hours.--Ed.
