Nor again, would we be thought to mean (even when

treating of simple natnres) any abstract forms οι· ideas²

either undefined or badly defined in matter. For when we
speak of forms, we mean nothing else than those lawe and
regulations of simple action which arrange and constitute
any simple nature, such as heat, light² weight, in every
’ ffle—cies of matter, aad in a susceptible subject. 'Phe form
of heat or form of light² therefore² means no more than the
law of heat or the law of light. Nor do we ever abstract or

withdraw ourselves from things, and the operative branch
· of philosophy. When, therefore, we say (tor instance) in
onr investigation of the form of heat, Reject rarity, or, Rar-

 

ity is not of the form oi heat, it is the same as if we were to
say, Man can superinduco heat on a dense body, or the re·
(verse, Man can abstract or ward off heat from a rare body.
But it our forms appear to any one to be somewhat ab·

stracted, from their mingling and uniting heterogeneous -

objects (the beat, ior instance, of the heavenly bodies ap·
pears to be very different from that of fire; the fixed red of
the rose and the like, from that which is apparent in the
rainbow, or the radiation of opal or the diamond;’¹ death
by drowning, from that by hurning, the swerd, apoplexy,
or consumption3 and yet they all agree in the common na-
tures of heat, redness, and death), let him be assured that
his understanding is inthralled by habit, by general appear-
ances and hypotheses. For it is most certain that, however
heterogeneous and distinct, they agree in the form or law
which regulates heat, redness, or death3 and that human
power cannot be emancipated and freed from the common

⁸¹ This general law or form has been well illustrated by Newton’a discovery
