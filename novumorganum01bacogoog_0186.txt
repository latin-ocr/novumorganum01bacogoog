- and turns from her ordinary eourse. For the errore of
nature differ from singular instanees, inasmneh as the lat-
·ter are the miracles of speeies, the former of individuale.
Their use is much the same, for they rectify the under-
standing in oppositioni to habit, and reveal common forms.
For with regal-d to these, also, we must not desist from in-
quii-y, till we diseern the eause of the deviation. 'I'he oause
does not, however, in such enses riso to a regular form, but
only to the latent process toward suoh a form. For he who
-is acquainted with the paths of nature, will more readily
observe· her deviations3 and, viee versa, he who has learned
” her deviatione will be able more accurately to describe
her pathe. . - .

They differ again from singular instanees, by ‚being
much more apt for practice and the operative braneh.

' · For it would be very difficult to generate new speeies,

but -less so to vary known speeies, and thus produce many
rare and unusual results.” 'I'he passage from the miracles
of nature to those of artis easy; for if nature be once seized
in her variatione, and the cause be manifest, it will be easy
to lead her by art to such deviation as she was at first led
to by ehan0e3 and not only to that but others, since devia·
tiens on the one side lead and open the way to others in
every direction. ot this we do not require any examples,
, since they are so abundant. For a compilation, or partiou-
lar natural history, must be made of all monsters and pro·
digious births oi nature, of everyihing, ‘in short, which is
new, rare and unusual in· nature. This should be done
with a rigorous selection, so as to be worthy of eredit.

⁸³ 'this is well illustr-ared in plante, ior the gai-dener een produce endlen
varietles of any known speeies, but ean-never produce a new speeies itself.
