itself to receive the former, and excludes or removes the
latter.” Nor is the effect or power of this motion confined
to contact, for the electric energy (of which Gilbert and
others after him have told so many sables) is only the
energy excited in a body by gentle friction, and which
does not endure the air, but prefers some tangible substance
if there be any at hand.

Let the seventh be that which we term the motion of
greater congregation, by which bodies are borne toward
masses of a similar-nature, for instance, heavy bodies toward
the earth, light to the sphere of heaven. The school· termed
this natural motion, by a superficial consideration of it, be·
cause produced by no external visible agent, which made
them consider it innate in the substances; or perhaps
because it does not cease, which is little to be wondered
at, since heaven and earth are always present, while the
causes and sources of many other motions are sometimes
absent and sometimes present. They therefore called this
perpetual and proper, because it is never interrupted, but
instantly takes place when the others are interrupted, and
they called the others adscititious. 'I'he former, however,
is in reality weak and sIOW, since it yields, and is inferior
to the others as long as they act, unless the mass of the
body be great3 and although this motion have so filled
men's minds, as almost to have obscured all others, yet
they know but little about it, and commit many errors in
its estimate.

Let the eighth be that which we term the motion of
lesser congregation, by which the homogeneous parts in
