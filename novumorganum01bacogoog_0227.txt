rubbed the bladder gently with cil, so aa to make it air·
tight, by closing ite poree with the oil. We tied the blad-
der tightly round the mouth of the vicl, which we had in·
eerted in it, and with a piece of waxed thread to make it
fit better and more tightly, and then placed the viel on
some hot coele in a brazicr. The vapor or eteam of the
spirit, dilated and become aeriform by the beat, gradually
ewelled out the bladder‚ end stretched it in every direction
like c sail. As soen aa that was accomplished‚ we removed
the vicl from the lire and placed it cn c carpess, that it
might not be cracked. by the cold; wc also pricked the
bladder immediately, that the exeam might not return tc a.
liquid etate by the cessation of beat, and conicund the prc-
portions. We then removed the blanda, and again took
the weight of the spirit which remained3 and so calculated
the quantity which hed been' converted into vapor, or an
aeriter-m ampo, and then examined how much space had
been occupied by the body in ite form of spirite of -wine in
the viel, and how much, on the other hand, hed· been-occu·

body, thus converted and changed, acquired an expaneion
of one hundred times beyond its former bulk.
