Pnrsnits of this natnre are certainly agreeable, and some·
times of practical advantage, bnt contribnte little or nothing
to the thorongh investigation of natnre. Onr labor mnst
therefore be directed toward inqniring into and observing
resemblanoes and analogies, both in the whole and its parts,
for they nnite natnre, and lay the foundation of the sciences.

Here, however, a severe and rigorons cantion must be
observed, that we only >consider as similar and proportionata
instances, those which (aa we first . observed) point ont
physical resemblances3 that is, real and snbstantial resem-
blances, deeply founded in nature, and not onenal and
superficial, much less superstitious or onrions3 snch as
those which are constantly pnt torward by the writers on
natural magio (the most idle of men, and who are scarcely
fit to be named in connection with anch serious matters as
· we now treet ot), who, with mnch vanity and folly, describe,
and sometimes too, invent, unmeaning resemblanoes and
sympatbies.

But leaving snch to themselves, similar instanoes are
not to be neglected, in the greater portione of the world’s
conformation3 snch as Africa and the Pern‘vian continent,
which reaches to the Straits‘of Magellan3 both of which
possess a similar isthmus and similar capes, a circumstance β
not to be attributed to mere accident. ⁸

Again, the New and Old World are both of them broad
and expanded toward the north, and narrow ⁸and pointed
toward the south.

Again, we have very remarkable similar instances in the
intense cold, toward the middle regions (as it is termed) of
the air, and the violent fires which are often fonnd to bnrst
from subterraneons spots, the similarity consisting in both
being ends and extremes3 the extreme ot the nature ofcold,
