tures, but by concrete bodies, as they are found in nature
and in its usual course. For instance, suppose the inquiry
ιο be, from what beginnings, in what manner, and by what
process gold or any metal or stone is generaoed from the
original menstruum, or its elementa, up ιο the perfect min·
eral: or, in like manner, by what process plante are gener·
ated, from the first concretion of juices in the earth, or from
seeds, up to the perfect plant, with the whole successive
motion, and varied and uninterrupted efforts of nature3 and
the same inquii-y be made as to a regularly deduced system
of the generation of animale from coition ιο birth, and so on
. of other bodies.

Nor is this species of inquiry confined to the mere gen-
eration of bodies, but it is applicable to other changes and
labors oi nature. For instance, where an inquiry is made
into the whole series and continued operation oi the nutriu
tive process, from the flrst reception of the food to its com·
plete assimilation ιο the recipient;' or into the voluntary
motion of animale, from the first impression oi the‘ imagina-
tion, and the continuone effecta of· the spirits, up to the
bending and motion· of the joints3 or into the free motion of

the tongue and lips, and other accessor-ies which give atter·-

ance ιο articulate sounds. For all these investigatione relate
to concrete or associated natures artificially brought together,
and take into consideration certain particular and special
habits oi nature, and not‘ those fundamental and general
lawe which constitute forms. It must, however, be plainly
owned, that this methcd appears more prompt and easy, and
- -of greater promise than the primary one.
