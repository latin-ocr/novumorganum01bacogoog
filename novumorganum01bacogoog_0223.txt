been recently changed, for the spirit itself has no weight.
The departure or omission of spirit is rendered sensible in
the rust of motula, and other putrefactione of. a like nature,
which stop before they arrive at the rudimenta of life, which
belong tc the third species of process.” {ln compact bodies
the spirit does not find porea and passages for its escape,
and is therefore obliged to force ont, and drivc before it,
the tangible parts also, which consequently prounde, whence
arises rust and the like. 'Phe conti-action of the tangible ·
parts, occasioned by the omission of part of the spirit
(whence arises desiccation)‚ is rendered sensible by the in-
creased hardness of the substance, and still more by the
fissures, contractione, shrivelling, and folda cf the bodies
thus produced. For the parta of wood split and conti-act,
skins become shrivelled‚ and not only that, but, if the
spirit be omitted suddenly by the heat of the fite, bc·
come so hastily contracted as to twist and roll thern·
solves up.

On the contrary, when the spirit is retained, and yet ex·
panded and excitcd by heat or the like (which happens in
solid and tenacions bodies), then the bodies are softened,

as in hot iron; or flow‚ as in metals3 or melt, as in guma, ·

wax, and the like. The contrary effecta of hest, therefore
(hai-dening some substances and melting others), are easily
reconciled‚⁸⁸ because the spirit is emitwd in the former, and

θ’ ant is now well known to be a chemieal combination cf oxygen with
the mot-l. and the metal when matr acquires additional weight. His theory
aa tc the mention of animus, is deducsd from the erroneofis action cf the
possibility of spontanecus gehennon (as it was tei-med). See the next para·
