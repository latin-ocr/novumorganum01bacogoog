as it were, spurious methodii.¹ Instances oi cold‚ therefore,
should be searched for most diligently, such as may be
found by exposing bodies upon buildings in a hard trost,
in subterraneous caverna, by surrounding bodies with snow
and ice in deep places e⁰icavated for that purpose, by let·

silver aud metals‚ by immersing them in streams which

ground for forty or fifty years, and to be transmitted to

· their heirs as a sort oi artificial mine) and the like. The

condensations which take place in nature, by means of cold‚
should also be investigated‚ that by learning their causes,
they may be introduced into the arts; such as are observed
in the exudatiou of marble and stones, in the dew upon the
panes of glass in a room toward morning aiter a iresty
night, in the fortnation and the gathering oi vapore under
the earth into water, whence spring iountains and the like.

Besides'the substances which are cold to the touch,
there are others which have also the effect of cold, and

condense the flesh and tangible parts, such as astringent
and inspissating medicines, others the· spirits, such as
soporifics. There are two modes of condensing the spirits,
by soporifics or provocatives to sleep; the one by calming
the motion‚.the other by expelling the spirit. 'Phe violet,
dried reses, lettuces, and other benign or mild remedia, by
their friendly and gently cooling vapors, invite the spirits
